1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,570
Okay, let's start off this lesson by first

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,270
making the important distinction
between savings and investment.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,240
Two terms which are often and
wrongly used interchangeably.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,930
So here's the important distinction.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,210
When your goal is simply to save money,

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,990
your primary goal is to protect
that money from any loss.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,170
So when you save,
you either put your money in a vault or

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,370
into very safe investment
vehicles like a money market or

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,980
the government bonds of a relatively safe
country like the United States or Canada.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,270
In contrast, when you invest your money
you are willing to take on more risk.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,133
Precisely because you are trying
to gain a higher return or reward.

12
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:49,951
So you might invest your money in any
number of vehicles that range from

13
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,770
stocks and real estate, to precious
metals like gold and silver, and

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,215
precious objects like fine art and
classic cars.

15
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:02,850
And that leads us to the first big
concept we have to wrap our heads around.

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,050
Basically, the idea of
the risk/reward ratio.

17
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,070
As a practical matter, the more risk you
are willing to take on as an investor,

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,670
the higher your reward or
return on that investment should be.

19
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,530
That's because the ultimate risk of an
investment is that you will lose some or

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,160
all of your investment
capital if things go wrong.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,700
So, for example, it's a lot riskier
to invest in corporate bonds than

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,310
government bonds, so corporate bonds
usually offer a high rate of interest.

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,720
Hey, if they didn't,
investors wouldn't buy them.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,680
They'd buy the safe
government bonds instead.

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,810
Similarly, it's a lot riskier to invest
in brand new technology stocks than

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,950
established blue chip stocks like
Proctor and Gamble and General Electric.

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,420
So generally, investors expect a higher
rate of return on these riskier stocks.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,800
As for the various risks you face, when
you invest in instruments like stocks,

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,800
real estate, gold or even impressionist
paintings, these risks come in many forms.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,280
For example, you might buy
a house hoping to flip it for

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,440
a quick profit and wind up seeing
housing prices suddenly plunge.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,070
That's how the whole 2007 financial
crisis started, and it wasn't pretty.

33
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,190
Or you may decide to become a gold bug.

34
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,340
I don't recommend that, and

35
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,160
invest your money in gold bars or any
one of a number of stock market trading

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,170
instruments that allow you to essentially
bet on the price of gold going higher.

37
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,970
However, if after you make your
gold investment, the economy goes

38
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,730
into a downturn and the rate of inflation
falls along with the industrial demand for

39
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,130
gold, you may suddenly find that
the $20,000 you dropped on the gold market

40
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,210
may only be worth half that.

41
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,280
So, the big point here,
is that whatever you invest in,

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,140
it's important not just the return or
reward being offered but

43
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,420
also the risks involved in making
that particular investment.

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,730
And now hear this, if the reward or

45
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,530
return being offered to you sounds
too good to be true, it probably is.

46
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,710
So don't get sucked into any
fly by night investments.

47
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:27,257
Whenever you might be tempted, remember
this axioms from the great philosopher,

48
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:32,738
WC Fields, never give a sucker an even
break, and you can't cheat an honest man.

49
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:34,795
>> Sir you impugn my honor.

50
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:39,503
As my dear old grandfather Lipbock
said just before the sprung the trap,

51
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:42,062
he said you can't cheat an honest man.

52
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,910
Never give a sucker an even break or

53
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,371
smarten up a chump
>> Okay,

54
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,960
enough about the risk reward ratio.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,788
When you're ready, let's move on to Part 2
of the lecture to examine the concept of

56
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:57,015
rate of return, a really cool financial
tool known as diversification.

57
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:05,299
