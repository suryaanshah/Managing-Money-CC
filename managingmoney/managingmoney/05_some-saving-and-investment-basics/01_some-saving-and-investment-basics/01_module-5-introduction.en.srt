00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:09,963
Hi, I'm Prof Nevarro.

3
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,253
>> I'm Alex LeBon.

4
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:14,093
>> So Mr. Alex, what do we got going on,
in this lesson?

5
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:15,842
>> Well, instead of going to work,

6
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:18,593
we're gonna figure out how
to put our money to work.

7
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:20,713
>> We're talking about saving and
investing.

8
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:22,210
>> Yes, indeed.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,200
>> Okay, so
what's our first big take away today?

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,450
>> Simply that the only way to
get a big return on an investment

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,540
is to take on significant risk.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,010
And learning how to evaluate
an investment's risk reward ratio,

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,160
is the beginning of
a wonderful investment career.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,770
>> Dude, you sound like Warren Buffet.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,600
>> [LAUGH]
>> I'm actually more of a Peter Lynch guy,

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,670
but that's another story.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,230
>> So what else do we have here?

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,570
>> Well, I'll show you why umbrellas and
suntan lotion,

19
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,580
are the keys to understanding
something called diversification.

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,430
>> Which do you recommend?

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,450
>> Who am I, your weather man?

22
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,170
>> I take your point.

23
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,970
But here's what I do want to know, should
I go out and buy a bunch of gold tomorrow?

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,510
>> You'll have to view this
lesson to find that out.

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,680
>> Alright, well let's do it.

26
