00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,410
Okay, as I promised, let's start off with
a brief discussion of just what is meant

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,960
by the concept of a return on investment,
or rate of return on investment.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,900
The easiest way to think about this is
to imagine that you invested $100 in

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,430
an investment vehicle on
January 1st of a given year.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,220
If your investment is worth $110
by December 31st of that year,

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,160
you've earned a rate of return of 10%.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,407
So if that investment is worth only $105,

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:36,530
the return is 5% and so on.

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,260
Now, in considering your rate of return,
the next big concept I want to introduce

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,280
is the difference between the nominal and
real rate of return on investment.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
The nominal return is that what
you see is what you get return.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,000
In our earlier example, if you wound
up with $110 on December 31st,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,034
your nominal return was 10%.

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,295
But, what if over the course of the year,
the rate of inflation was 10%.

15
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:08,850
In this case, your real rate of return,

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,140
which is the nominal rate minus the rate
of inflation, would be a big fat zero.

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,190
In other words all you would have done
that year is tread water with your

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:26,990
investment because your $110 is worth the
same as the $100 you invested a year ago.

19
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,095
And sure you now could cash
that investment in for

20
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:35,020
$110 but your purchasing power
would not have increased because

21
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,610
with inflation everything
costs a little bit more.

22
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,860
The broader point here is to pay attention
to how inflation may affect your

23
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,650
investment returns.

24
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,290
And that kind of attention may help
you choose investment vehicles that

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,830
are better at protecting you from
things like inflation or recession.

26
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,170
This fact is an excellent segue to
the concept of diversification.

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,714
The central idea behind diversification
is that different investment vehicles

28
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:06,187
have different levels of risk,
and sometimes, by combining

29
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:10,010
the right investment vehicles,
you can reduce your overall risk.

30
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:15,015
The classic example to teach
diversification is that of the umbrella

31
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:18,130
company and the suntan lotion company.

32
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,700
In any given year, if it rains a lot
more than the sun shines, the umbrella

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,850
company is going to make relatively more
profit than the suntan lotion company.

34
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,220
Of course, the opposite is true
when a drought rolls in and

35
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,880
the sun shines high in
the sky all day long.

36
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,200
Now, as an investor with, say,
a million bucks, hey, I'm a generous guy.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,340
You could choose to invest in the stock
of either one of the two companies.

38
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,110
And if it's a rainy year and you picked
the umbrella company, you would win big.

39
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,120
But on the downside,

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,300
if you picked the suntan lotion company,
you would get burned.

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,510
Sorry about that pun.

42
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,520
So to diversify, one thing you
could do is simply divide your

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,980
investment funds equally
between the two companies.

44
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,240
That way, in the parlance of Wall Street,
you have hedged your risk.

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,560
For, if one company suffers
in any given weather year,

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,870
chances are the other
company will do well.

47
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,536
Of course the key point here as you move
forward in your life is to be aware not

48
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:25,315
just of the various risks of investment,
but also be mindful

49
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:29,709
of how you can allocate your investment
funds to diversify your risk.

50
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:38,479
