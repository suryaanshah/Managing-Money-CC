[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Prof Nevarro. >> I'm Alex LeBon. >> So Mr. Alex, what do we got going on,
in this lesson? >> Well, instead of going to work, we're gonna figure out how
to put our money to work. >> We're talking about saving and
investing. >> Yes, indeed. >> Okay, so
what's our first big take away today? >> Simply that the only way to
get a big return on an investment is to take on significant risk. And learning how to evaluate
an investment's risk reward ratio, is the beginning of
a wonderful investment career. >> Dude, you sound like Warren Buffet. >> [LAUGH]
>> I'm actually more of a Peter Lynch guy, but that's another story. >> So what else do we have here? >> Well, I'll show you why umbrellas and
suntan lotion, are the keys to understanding
something called diversification. >> Which do you recommend? >> Who am I, your weather man? >> I take your point. But here's what I do want to know, should
I go out and buy a bunch of gold tomorrow? >> You'll have to view this
lesson to find that out. >> Alright, well let's do it. [MUSIC]
