1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:05,360
So how about we finish up this lesson with
a discussion of some of the reasons why

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,950
you may invest.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,840
And some of the investment vehicles you
may want to consider as you move forward

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,800
in life and start to accumulate more and
more savings and capital.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,110
As to why it's never too soon to think
about investing rather than mere saving.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,300
Putting your money to work for

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,590
you in reasonable investments is
the best way to grow your wealth.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,560
In fact the difference between investing
and not investing is often the difference

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,880
between being able to buy a new car or
a new house or retiring early and not.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,820
Just remember our fable about
the profligate grasshopper Juan.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,240
In the diligent ant Juanita.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,100
At any rate, the question becomes

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,140
just what is the best way to invest
your money as you move through time.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,970
The general rule here is that
you should be willing to take on

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,140
a bit more risk in your youth.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,640
But, as you approach and enter retirement,

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,610
you will want to take on a lot less
risk and simply preserve capital.

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,330
As to what investment
vehicles are out there,

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,185
the main categories include most
obviously stocks and bonds.

20
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:15,155
In addition, there are real estate
opportunities to speculate in.

21
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:18,245
Along with more exotic
investments in precious objects.

22
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,525
Like fine art and classic cars.

23
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:25,735
In addition, as I alluded to earlier,
a lot of people become

24
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:30,870
infatuated with the idea of investing in
precious metals like gold and silver.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,380
Not necessarily a bad idea, but

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,520
an idea that nonetheless
carries considerable risk.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,380
While we will devote the entire next
lesson to stock market investing,

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,550
it is worthwhile to hit some of
the highlights when it comes to some of

29
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,250
these other investment vehicles.

30
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,290
Let's start with bonds.

31
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,150
Regardless of the type of bond that
you are buying, the basic idea

32
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,000
is that you put down a sum of money and
you are promised two things in return.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,030
All of your money back when the bond
reaches its maturity and a specific

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,239
interest rate paid on those funds
while the bond moves towards maturity.

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,090
As per maturity dates, these could be
anything depending on the particular bond.

36
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,420
Thirty days in the case of treasury bills
or perhaps a ten year corporate bond note.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,310
Now the thing to understand about
bonds is they are not necessarily safe

38
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,780
despite the mythology that
has grown up around them.

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,290
In fact, there's a whole class
of so-called junk bonds,

40
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,880
which pay a far higher interest
rate than US government bonds, but

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,330
they also have a much
higher risk of default.

42
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,980
The second thing to
understand about bonds,

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,140
is that you can choose between bonds where
you have to pay income tax on the interest

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,930
verses tax free bonds where
the interest is exempt and

45
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,560
by the way these tax free bonds
are typically issued by local and

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,890
state governments as allowed by law.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
However, as a practical matter
you don't wanna be loading

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,960
up on tax free bonds until you are earning
quite a bit of income to begin with.

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,280
That's because everything else being
equal, tax-free bonds offer lower

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,130
interest rates precisely because
taxes need not be paid on them.

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,940
Now, what about real estate?

52
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,760
Here, the first thing
you have to know is that

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,710
real estate is considered to
be a very illiquid asset.

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,010
What I mean by that is,
you can't just sell a house or

55
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,910
an apartment building with
the snap of your fingers or

56
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,720
the click of your mouse,
like you can with the share of a stock.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,970
Because that is true, it's important for

58
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,300
you to consider more broadly the degree
of liquidity of any investment you make.

59
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,300
If you think you might need that money
quickly, you will be better off investing

60
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,020
in relatively more liquid assets, even if
they may offer slightly lower returns.

61
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,560
As for our precious metals, like gold and

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,770
silver, I alluded to the big problem
with this investment vehicle.

63
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,980
It is highly sensitive to the ups and
downs of the economy and business cycle.

64
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,730
So don't get caught up in
the hype of precious metals and

65
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,540
if you are going to be a gold bug
at least be an intelligent one

66
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,510
that understands the reasons why metals
like gold and silver rise and fall.

67
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,710
It's all about the rate of inflation.

68
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,170
The robustness of an economy, and
any heightened uncertainty in the world.

69
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,835
Now, what about precious objects like fine
art, stamp collections and classic cars?

70
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes, indeed these are an alternative
investment vehicles.

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,200
But guess what,

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,300
unless you are an expert in
the particular field in which you invest.

73
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,320
Don't go there.

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,460
In fact, these kinds of investments
are primarily the preserve of people who

75
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,220
already have more money
than they can count.

76
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,691
I'm assuming that's not you.

77
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:03,527
Now, the last thing I want to talk about
in this lesson is one of the great powers

78
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:04,860
in economics.

79
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,160
The power of compounding.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,520
Compounding is what happens when you
reinvest your investment earnings.

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,000
That is, when you add your earnings
to your original invest principal.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,220
Technically, compound interest means
that the interest you earn each year

83
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,380
is added to your principal.

84
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,390
That means your balance doesn't just grow,
it grows at an increasing rate.

85
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,333
The result is a large earnings base
upon which your earnings can continue to

86
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,091
accumulate.

87
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,836
To see the power of compound interest,

88
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:40,340
let's bring back our stars of Lesson One,
Juan and Juanita.

89
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,040
Back for an on course scenario.

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,292
In Juan's case, he receives
an unexpected inheritance of $10,000.

91
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:53,050
And at least he has the sense to invest
it, rather than blow it on a big party or

92
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,610
vacation.

93
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,470
This rare sensible move notwithstanding,

94
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,740
Juan nonetheless decides to spend
the interest he earns every year.

95
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,980
So, at a 10% interest rate, this would
allow him to blow $1,000 in extra income

96
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,690
every year and he would still have his
$10,000 in principle some 20 years later.

97
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,960
Juanita, on the other hand,
has a different idea.

98
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,540
When she gets a similar $10,000
inheritance, she lets her investment ride

99
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,100
over the next 20 years in anticipation
of having to pay college tuition for

100
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,570
her kids.

101
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,394
Over this period, through the power
of compound interest, her $10,000

102
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:37,390
thereby grows to $67,275.

103
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,100
You can try out your own example and

104
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,750
see the power of compounding
at the website moneychimp.com.

105
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,524
It's pretty cool.

106
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:54,667
At any rate, the last words of wisdom I
can offer on this subject of saving and

107
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:58,898
investing Is that none of it is possible
unless you have the kind of sound

108
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:02,120
budgeting plan I described in Lesson One.

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,350
That's why,
as I said at the outset of this course,

110
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,420
that everything we teach is entangled in
an interrelated web of personal finance.

111
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,120
So get curious about your investment
options early in your life and

112
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,770
you'll be prepared to invest once
the money starts rolling in.

113
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,439
From that great job that college
education is going to get you.

114
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,923
Fingers crossed.

115
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:34,923
