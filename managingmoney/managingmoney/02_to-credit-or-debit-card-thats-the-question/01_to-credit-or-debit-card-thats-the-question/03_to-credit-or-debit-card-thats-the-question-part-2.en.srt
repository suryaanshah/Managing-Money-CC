1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,330
Since both credit and
debit cards each have their pros and

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,210
cons, which is the best for us to use?

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,900
Or maybe it might make sense for us to
have both types of cards, use each for

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,090
specific and different purposes?

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,257
So let's think about that now.

6
00:00:13,257 --> 00:00:16,737
Tonight we're seeing how each one
might fit into an overall smart and

7
00:00:16,737 --> 00:00:18,780
efficient financial plan.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,910
With a debit card, you can only spend
the money you already have in the bank.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,835
A big advantage is you don't have to
deal with the hassle of actual cash.

10
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:30,335
And the debit cards excel at
small day-to-day transactions,

11
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:32,515
like gas, groceries or lunch.

12
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:34,505
With a debit card,

13
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:38,620
your statements show you in real time
how much money you have left to spend.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,100
That makes it easy to budget out money for
each week or between your pay checks.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,460
So as long as your expenditures
are relatively small and

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,530
your in flow of money into
the account can keep up.

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,690
The debit card is the stronger
of the two tools for

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,470
these smaller recurring expenses.

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,930
But what happens when for example,
your hot water heater breaks and

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,040
you need to call a plumber to fix it.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,370
Paying a couple of hundred bucks
straight out of your account for

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,930
this could either drain your savings
account, or set your budget for food and

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,690
gas way back until your next paycheck.

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,666
Almost to the point of having to subsist
entirely off of ramen again, but you

25
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:18,600
are a savvy person and you have a credit
card for just this type of situation.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,400
With a credit card,
you can pay that large unexpected bill and

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,490
have time to collect more money from work.

28
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,580
Or your other accounts to pay
the bill at the end of the month

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,640
without wrecking your budget.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,770
And even if you can't pay the full
amount right away that month,

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,100
you can break the payment up
into more manageable sizes.

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,230
And here's a really important point.

33
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,600
If you pay off your entire credit
card debt every month on time,

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,130
you won't be charged any interest at all.

35
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,520
But if you do get into a situation where
you have a large expense you have to incur

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,630
and you charge it to your credit card.

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,370
Even if you don't have funds to
cover it at the end of the month,

38
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,570
you must at least pay
the minimum payment due.

39
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,330
In such a case you'll pay interest
on the remaining balance.

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,990
But if you miss a minimum balance payment,
you'll not only be charged a late fee.

41
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,880
The credit card company can also increase
the APR or interest rate it charges you,

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,350
often to obscene levels.

43
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,680
Let me be really honest with you here.

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,190
The credit card companies
are not your friends.

45
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,350
Sure they send you a bunch of happy
sounding applications in the mail all

46
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,750
the time hoping to get your business.

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,510
But if you get behind on your credit card,
they really don't care.

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,490
In fact, they make a lot more money on you
because they can charge people with little

49
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,200
credit history like us.

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,000
High interest rates, like 20% or
more, even when the interest rate and

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,490
the general economy is well below 5%.

52
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,630
So don't get hooked on credit card debt.

53
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,258
It will not only send you to the
poorhouse, it will also kill your credit

54
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:48,710
score, as I will explain more in
the lecture about credit history.

55
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,650
Now let me get back to some of
the virtues of credit cards,

56
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,620
because they are certainly not all bad.

57
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,920
Here, one thing credit
cards are really handy for

58
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,360
is making large planned purchases.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,930
For example, you might not have enough
money sitting around to splurge on,

60
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,490
say a new energy efficient refrigerator.

61
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,690
However, with a credit card you
can still make the purchase and

62
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,640
just spread the payments
out over a few months.

63
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,580
You might end up paying interest, but

64
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,810
you might come out ahead with
the energy savings from the new fridge.

65
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,590
By the way,
one final downside of a credit card

66
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,170
is that cost are harder to keep
track of than with a debit card.

67
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,350
This is because,
unless you wanna go online and

68
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,420
check, your statements will typically
be available only once a month.

69
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,840
In other words, you don't get that
instant tally of your remaining

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,790
funds that makes a debit card so
easy to manage.

71
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,020
Thus for a credit card,
it can be tempting to overspend and

72
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,770
then get hit with a huge
bill that is hard to pay.

73
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,280
Luckily, there are tools
out there like Mint.

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,340
That help keep track of multiple
accounts and cards to track balances,

75
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,970
spending habits and other statistics
to help manage our money well.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,380
Using tools like this, you can find
a plan that helps leverage the pros and

77
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,040
cons of both debit and credit cards.

78
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Since everyone has
different spending habits,

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,770
a different balance will work
differently for everyone.

80
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,900
But it's important to have both debit and

81
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,750
credit cards around, as they give you
more options to manage your money.

82
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,257
And unlike with a debit card,
a credit card properly managed can start

83
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,885
you down the road to building
a good credit history.

84
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,729
This will certainly pay dividends down
the line in the form of lower interest

85
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,050
rates in applying for car loans,
business loans and mortgages.

86
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:35,409
