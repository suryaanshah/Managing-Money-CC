00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,649
Hi, Prof Navarro here
>> And I'm Alex LaBon.

3
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:13,406
>> Okay, Alex.

4
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,830
What will we be covering
in today's lecture?

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,859
>> Well today we'll be talking
credit cards and debit cards.

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,764
We'll go into the differences
between the two and

7
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:26,480
talk about what this beast
called APR actually is.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,820
And we'll also talk about how to best
use these two types of cards to better

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,170
manage your money.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,930
>> All right man, so what's the bigger
picture here with these things?

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,470
>> Well, a lot of younger folks,
like me, are hesitant to take on debt.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,460
Why should we willingly put ourselves
at the behest of huge banks?

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,345
>> Going off the grid, are we?

14
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:47,880
>> [LAUGH] Not quite, but
credit cards can be dangerous.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,720
They encourage you to spend
less reasonably sometimes and

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,990
by their nature encourage debt to the man.

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,510
>> So, two thumbs down on credit cards?

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,630
>> Not exactly.

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,320
If you manage them intelligently,

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,560
you can reap the benefits of credit
card without being neck deep in debt.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,520
It's all about having a plan in mind for
handling our money the best we can.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,880
>> Okay, so what are the main
takeaways from this lesson?

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,884
>> Well, I'll show you why a debit card
excels for small, everyday expenses,

24
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:16,757
while a credit card is useful sometimes
for unexpected costs or purchasing

25
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:20,456
expensive but useful capital goods
>> So each card has its strength and

26
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,974
weaknesses, is that what you're saying?

27
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:26,671
>> Yup, and it'll help our students
develop an idea of how you use these two

28
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,828
together in harmony.

29
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:29,557
>> All right sounds like a plan.

30
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,753
Where do you want to start today?

31
00:01:30,753 --> 00:01:32,239
>> We'll start with debit cards.

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,912
>> All righty.

33
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:33,876
Now off you go.

34
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:41,419
