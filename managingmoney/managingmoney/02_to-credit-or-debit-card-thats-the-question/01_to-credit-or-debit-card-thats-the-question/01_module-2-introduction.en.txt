[MUSIC] Hi, Prof Navarro here
>> And I'm Alex LaBon. >> Okay, Alex. What will we be covering
in today's lecture? >> Well today we'll be talking
credit cards and debit cards. We'll go into the differences
between the two and talk about what this beast
called APR actually is. And we'll also talk about how to best
use these two types of cards to better manage your money. >> All right man, so what's the bigger
picture here with these things? >> Well, a lot of younger folks,
like me, are hesitant to take on debt. Why should we willingly put ourselves
at the behest of huge banks? >> Going off the grid, are we? >> [LAUGH] Not quite, but
credit cards can be dangerous. They encourage you to spend
less reasonably sometimes and by their nature encourage debt to the man. >> So, two thumbs down on credit cards? >> Not exactly. If you manage them intelligently, you can reap the benefits of credit
card without being neck deep in debt. It's all about having a plan in mind for
handling our money the best we can. >> Okay, so what are the main
takeaways from this lesson? >> Well, I'll show you why a debit card
excels for small, everyday expenses, while a credit card is useful sometimes
for unexpected costs or purchasing expensive but useful capital goods
>> So each card has its strength and weaknesses, is that what you're saying? >> Yup, and it'll help our students
develop an idea of how you use these two together in harmony. >> All right sounds like a plan. Where do you want to start today? >> We'll start with debit cards. >> All righty. Now off you go. [MUSIC]
