1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,650
So we've gone over how credit and
debit cards differ.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,300
And how each one can have an effective
role in our financial plan.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,570
But how do we actually go about
getting these cards in our pocket?

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,765
Debit cards are pretty simple to get.

5
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:17,905
Banks typically will give you one when you
open up a checking or savings account.

6
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:20,505
If you have an account with a bank,
but no card.

7
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:23,625
A quick visit to the nearest branch
should correct that in short order.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,345
For credit cards, there are more options.

9
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:31,640
Since a credit card isn't
tied to a specific account,

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,660
you don't have to go through a bank.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,700
In fact companies like airlines,
home improvement stores, and

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,620
department stores offer credit cards too.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,179
So how do we choose where to get a card?

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,970
First we have to distinguish between
the myriad of credit card types.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,450
For starters, we have the standard
unsecured credit card.

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,470
That is most often taken out with a bank.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,909
By unsecured, I mean that obtaining a card
doesn't involve any type of collateral.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,660
However, there are secured
cards out there.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,970
That demand collateral of someone
typically with a poor credit history.

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,720
Where collateral means putting up
some type of asset like a car, boat,

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
jewelry, or a cash deposit.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,454
If you fail to pay off the credit card,
you would lose your collateral.

23
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:19,081
Ouch.

24
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:24,421
There are also reward cards that
give points for each dollar spent.

25
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:29,110
And enable you to redeem those points for
certain rewards or incentives.

26
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,810
These cards often require
a good credit history.

27
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,320
But can net you cash back, travel and

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,240
hotel rewards, gas savings,
retail rewards.

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,780
For both online and brick and

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,720
mortar locations, and any variety
of things the company might offer.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,880
But be careful these cards often
come with additional fees.

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,600
So in order to get the most
out of the rewards,

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,190
it is important to pay
balances off quickly.

34
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,400
Otherwise you'll come out with a net
loss over a standard credit card.

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,240
Still another genre of credit card
is called a balance transfer card.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,710
That enables the user to consolidate
the balance of multiple cards onto one.

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,970
Often with a lower interest rate.

38
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,780
Beware though,
having multiple credit cards and

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,030
juggling the balances like
this can sometimes backfire.

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,510
And will negatively affect
your credit history

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,180
as we'll talk more about in
the lecture on credit history.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,270
There are also specialty cards for

43
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,250
business which offer some of
the perks of normal cards.

44
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,400
With additional tools and
features for business owners.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,380
Like expense reports, additional cards for
employees, and higher credit limits.

46
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,830
The additional features of a business
card vary between the companies that

47
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,360
offer them.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,110
But they are useful tools for
entrepreneurs and executives alike.

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,880
A last major sub type of credit card is
meant particularly for students like us.

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,310
They are scaled back in terms of
what perks and features they offer.

51
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,840
But are good starting points for
students with little or

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,146
no established credit history.

53
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:03,040
And here's a big plus, these student
cards can be a strong tool for

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,830
building a good credit
history while in school.

55
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,650
So that you can get a full
service card with a good rate and

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,660
desirable perks after graduation.

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,050
For a first credit card it might be smart
to see what options your bank might offer.

58
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,610
Often if you already have an account
in good standing with the bank

59
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,710
they'll give you a better rate.

60
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,390
After shopping around a bit,
we find a card we're interested in and

61
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,720
start to fill in the application.

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,530
The applications are pretty
straightforward for the most part.

63
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,180
But so you know what to expect and

64
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,280
what information to have handy,
here's a sample application.

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,140
At the top, companies will often ask you
to choose which card you are applying for.

66
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,020
Sometimes they'll provide
more info on each card.

67
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,900
But you should have your research
completed before you make a final choice.

68
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,810
Read all the terms and
stipulations on the contract.

69
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,050
This isn't some software agreement that
you can skip over with little consequence.

70
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,195
There are important terms and conditions.

71
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,755
That affect your money and
how the card works.

72
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:04,205
Skipping over these can be a huge
mistake if you miss an important part of

73
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,735
the contract.

74
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:11,205
Second, the application will ask for your
contact information, your name, address.

75
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:15,985
Contact info and other biological
information, your citizenship status.

76
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:19,325
And perhaps for info on a relative or
personal reference.

77
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,220
Next they will ask about your employment
history and financial standing.

78
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,920
These questions are pretty
straight forward.

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,500
And give the bank information on how
much money you typically make and spend.

80
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,670
For students applications,

81
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,190
they might ask you about,
academic history, graduation date.

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,960
As well as other jobs you may have had.

83
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,800
If you're applying for
a car with certain features,

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,960
often you will need to fill out
additional information too.

85
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,010
Here, there is info about a balance
transfer program that would help

86
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,900
consolidate debt.

87
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,200
Near the end, companies will often ask if
you need an additional card for a spouse,

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,920
child or partner.

89
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,960
The card will be linked to your account,
but would have their name on the front.

90
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,665
Plus the company will ask about
the best way to send you a bill.

91
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:06,565
These days, companies are trying to
cut costs by going paperless and

92
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,345
sending bills online.

93
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:12,875
So they might include a small fee if you
want a paper bill sent to you every month.

94
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,115
The final section will usually
be a legal declaration

95
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,355
stating that the information
you filled in is true.

96
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:21,715
And that you authorize the company
to collect info about you for

97
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:22,415
a credit history.

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,480
Read the statement carefully as there
sometimes be additional stipulations you

99
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,620
might not want.

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,450
Like an application or processing fee.

101
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,010
That's it for this lesson.

102
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,560
Here's some of the key points we covered.

103
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,490
One.

104
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,470
It's good financial planning to have both,
a credit and debit card.

105
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,520
Two.

106
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,550
Debit cards are great for
small, daily expenditures.

107
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,830
But with a debit card you can't
spend more than you have, and

108
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,920
in an emergency you may need to do that.

109
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,380
Three.

110
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,840
Credit cards are great for those larger
purchases, planned or in emergencies.

111
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,570
Because they help you spread the costs
out over several months until you can

112
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,620
pay the amount off.

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,700
Four.

114
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,567
But just remember to always pay
your minimum credit card balance.

115
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,166
Or risk both high interest rates and
bad credit scores.

116
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:16,089
