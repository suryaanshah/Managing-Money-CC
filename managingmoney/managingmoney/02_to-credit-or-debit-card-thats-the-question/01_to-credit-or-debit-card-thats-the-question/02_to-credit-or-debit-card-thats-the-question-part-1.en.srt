1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,080
Take a look at these.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,160
Sure, they look the same but this one's
a credit card, this one's a debit card.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,650
So what the heck is the difference?

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,990
>> Well, debit cards work.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,580
By drawing money directly from
an associated checking or

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,325
savings account to pay for transactions.

7
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,095
There is no monthly bill to pay.

8
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:19,805
Instead the money in your
account is subtracted or

9
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:22,605
debited every time you make a purchase.

10
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,345
This way of spending makes
transactions very easy to track.

11
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,575
Rather than accounting by hand and trying
to match that to a monthly statement.

12
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:34,805
Most banks offer online features to
directly monitor how much money there is

13
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,300
available in your account.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,240
And what transactions have taken place.

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,410
For example,
this is my account page with Chase.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,900
Here I can check the balance of my
checking account linked to my debit card.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,910
And track the expenses associated with it.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,230
It's like a live, updating bank statement.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,920
I can see instantly how much
money I have to work with

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,380
when creating a budget for myself.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,690
I can also go into settings and
have the bank e-mail me.

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,750
If there's a large transaction or

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,900
if the account balance gets
beneath a certain point.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,170
With a credit card, the bank lends
you money for each transaction.

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,100
Then you pay them the outstanding
balance at the end of every month.

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,330
If you can't pay all of it,

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,150
the remaining balance carries
over to the next statement.

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,490
And you are charged interest for

29
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,410
the remaining money that
the bank has lent to you.

30
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,500
Often, the rate you are charged is called
the APR, or Annual Percentage rate.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
The APR is the combined interest and

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,700
fees you would expect to see over
a one year period of a loan.

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,190
As this handy graph from Wikipedia shows,

34
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,420
if you were to borrow $100
over the course of a year.

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,130
You would add up the fees and compounded
interest of paying the loan back and

36
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,610
you would get the APR.

37
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,360
In this case, it's 49%.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,970
Now, a quick word on
the concept of credit.

39
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,810
It's called credit because it adds on
to a balance of what you owe the bank.

40
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,610
Rather than subtracting or
debiting straight from your account.

41
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,470
Institutions keep track of your
history with paying these balances.

42
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,490
And compile it into a credit report
which has a score associated with it.

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,530
It essentially quantifies
your past history in

44
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,300
regards to paying debts on time.

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,330
And how able you are to take on new debts.

46
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,300
Taking out larger lines of credit, i.e,
loans, and paying them off sooner and

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,240
on time give more points.

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,730
Your credit score is really important,
because it is used when you apply for

49
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,370
most lines of credit.

50
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,380
As a general rule, the higher your credit
score, the less risk the bank sees you as.

51
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,990
And the APR you pay will be lower.

52
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,830
On the other end of things,
a person with a lower credit score

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,070
is seen as a higher risk
to lend to by institutions.

54
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,840
So he or she would get a higher
rate to compensate for

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,950
the perceived risk of default.

56
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,500
Where default means you don't
pay the loan on time, or at all.

57
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,263
We'll talk more about credit
reports later in the course.

58
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,427
But I wanted to show you how they
affect payments for a credit card.

59
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:09,519
