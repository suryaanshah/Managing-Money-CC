1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,530
As a small business owner, you will
find that your business is inexorably

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,780
intertwined with your personal finances.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,120
>> Sometimes that's good,
but often, it's a nuisance.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,610
>> In fact, as you get along in the world,

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,700
you will notice that all sorts of
forms you get from the government or

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,630
from companies you do business with,
will ask about your employment.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,700
>> But now hear it is.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,350
If you go to rent an apartment or
get an auto loan,

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,440
the moment you check off self-employed,

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,730
you'll find that you've opened up
a Pandora's box of further paperwork.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,380
>> These people, your creditors,
want to be sure they're going to be paid.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,710
And if you list your job as tenured
professor at the University of California,

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,960
they're pretty sure you're gonna get
your paycheck on a regular basis and

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,880
will be working next year.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,950
On the other hand, if you list
yourself as owner, Sarah's Cupcakes,

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,940
they may be thinking, can she possibly
make enough money to buy this car?

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,148
And the sad news is,

18
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:57,714
as a small business owner you are simply
less likely to get personal credit.

19
00:00:57,714 --> 00:01:00,453
And here's a cruel catch 22.

20
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:03,712
On the one hand, folks you wanna borrow
money from will want you to have

21
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:06,972
a plethora of financial statements
to show your business is stable and

22
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:07,980
highly profitable.

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,130
On the other hand, as a small business
owner, you will usually strive to keep

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,500
your on-book profits as low as possible
in order to reduce your taxes.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,070
Done legitimately, this is,
of course, legal and ethical.

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,830
However, the profits you actually
show may not be impressive enough for

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,689
you to qualify for a loan or credit.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,130
And here's another key tip when
it comes to getting credit.

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,710
Be sure to only choose those business
partners who share your dedication to

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,560
building up a strong credit history and
paying their income taxes.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
So sit down with your potential partners
before you go into business and

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,620
talk personal finance.

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,340
In fact,
make them watch this video series.

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,400
>> Time out here Professor Audrey.

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,080
I have to admit that you've almost scared
me out of launching my own business.

36
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,590
>> Not to worry Alex it's only
because I've saved the best for last.

37
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,480
As we finish I'm gonna show you
there a lot of really creative and

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,460
rewarding things that an entrepreneur can
legally do to use a business to make his

39
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,149
or her personal financial
situation more rewarding.

40
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,350
>> So, what exactly do you have in mind?

41
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,500
>> Well, suppose you're running that
delivery business I talked about earlier

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,340
and it requires the business to own a car.

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,140
>> Now if you were a corporate bean
counter in charge of vehicle acquisition

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,680
for the very big delivery service of
America, you'd probably buy a fleet of

45
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,200
whatever abysmal, generic little white
boxes some car company was trying to dump

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,610
because nobody wanted to be seen debt and
the things.

47
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,960
But wait, you've got to drive
this thing and you are in charge.

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,530
And so here's the punch line.

49
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,940
Within reason, nobody can tell you
what to buy for your company and

50
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,930
write off on your taxes.

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,910
So maybe you feel that Alex's Speedy
Documents should be delivered in a truck

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,560
or an SUV with towing capacity for a boat.

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,760
Or maybe a sporty little convertible
emblazoned with your company's logo

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,270
would add a nice marketing
twist to the business.

55
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,600
Of course, neither is the most practical
choice for delivering documents.

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,020
But now, hear this,
it is your choice and within reason,

57
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,880
the tax authorities won't question it.

58
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,690
Now here's another possible benefit.

59
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,190
It has to do with where you are actually
going to house your business.

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,750
In fact, many entrepreneurs
start right in their homes.

61
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,540
And in today's world of online commerce,
a traditional brick and

62
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,710
mortar location is less and
less necessary.

63
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,010
>> For example, I myself have run a $2
million a year computer business with

64
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,470
a dozen workers, and no offices at all.

65
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,150
And here's the key tip.

66
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,670
When you dedicate space in
your office to business,

67
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,330
not only do you get to make
deals in your pajamas.

68
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,050
You also get some nice tax
deductions on the part of the home

69
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,560
in which you do business.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,590
And guess what?

71
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,890
Those tax savings may help
you to afford a bigger and

72
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,860
nicer home than you otherwise could.

73
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,620
Score another one for
being an entrepreneur.

74
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,790
And on that note, being an entrepreneur
may put you in a better position to retire

75
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,750
way down the road as well.

76
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,100
That's because in the United States,
there are all sorts of tax

77
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,970
savings accounts that self-employed
folks can benefit from.

78
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,780
Lastly, you've surely heard the adage,
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

79
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,170
It's a popular economic truism, and
Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman,

80
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,720
even used it for the title of a book.

81
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,860
However, while you can't get a free lunch,
let me tell you that you can surely

82
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,730
get a tax deductible one if you
are a small business owner, that is.

83
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,840
Here the occasional working
lunch with staff, customers,

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,530
vendors, or
your account is a perfectly valid expense,

85
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,370
particularly if you don't have
office space in which to meet.

86
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,210
And within reason, you get to choose
a meal, at least partially subsidized by

87
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,890
the quite legitimate tax write off for
entertainment expenses.

88
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,260
I'll have the steak special,
rather than the burger please.

89
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,260
In the same vane,
there are also travel expense write offs.

90
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,530
So if your in the video game business,

91
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,720
your trip to E3 in Vegas,
just got about 40% cheaper.

92
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,340
>> Of course with all the things I've
suggested here, the rules can be complex.

93
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,049
So let your savvy accountant keep you
within the lines because as Alex explain

94
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,808
in an earlier lesson,
tax crime never pays.

95
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:04,373
>> And that's a wrap.

96
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:14,373
