1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,580
Despite what you may get taught about the
free market in undergraduate economics,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,740
everything in the real business world
takes place within a framework established

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,020
by governments at several levels,
local, state, and federal.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,420
>> In fact, it's almost impossible to
start a business without falling under one

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,570
set of rules or another, and guess what?

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,630
You're the one that's responsible for
knowing what they are.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,920
>> As for the types of enterprises
most prone to government regulation,

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,870
these are the ones that affect either
public safety or the environment.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,410
So, if you are manufacturing anything,
transporting people, making food,

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,850
or selling anything people ingest,

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,600
expect to spend a lot of time
talking to the folks downtown.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,250
>> And here's a big caution flag.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,520
Failing to have right permit or

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,970
license can mean being shut down,
fined, or possibly even going to jail.

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,630
So, check out those rules and
regulations beforehand.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,396
Now, here's another interesting place the
government gets involved in your budding

17
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:02,260
business, what the name of your
business is and who actually runs it.

18
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,001
Here are the ideas that customers and

19
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,610
others have a right to know who might
be lurking behind the shingle you hang.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,710
If you're doing business under the name,
Sarah's Cupcakes,

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,240
that's all find and good.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,940
But even if your name is Sarah, you're
going to have to file what's called a DBA,

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,520
or a "doing business as" form,
usually with the county and

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,940
publish and announcement in a local paper,
record or online.

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,150
The broader point is this,
it's your job to figure out

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,010
what regulations you will have to
abide by if you start a new business.

27
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,410
Another way your enterprise will
interact with the government,

28
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,090
is through the taxes you will have to pay.

29
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,730
I know Alex has covered
this topic in some detail.

30
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,080
But let me share with you a personal
story that makes an important point about

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,840
understanding your tax obligations.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,060
When I was in high school,

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,310
I launched a business developing video
games that continued into college.

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,740
One of the clients I had found had
a demand for a very large volume of

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,689
very simple games, and I couldn't
keep up with the programming myself.

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,590
Being the enterprising entrepreneur I am,
I rounded up all the kids in

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,280
the neighborhood and
taught them to code games.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,030
We wrote a lot of games and
generated more than $50,000 in sales.

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,740
And I paid my apprentice software
engineers cash for their work.

40
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,060
As it turns out, there was a lot
of tax paperwork I should've done

41
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,359
to handle this correctly, but
I had not bothered to research.

42
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,160
So it was that I soon found myself sitting
in my shorts and sandles squirming

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,044
uncomfortably in a stuffy government
office, while a bespeckled IRS auditor in

44
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:37,270
an intimidating suit browsed through
a shoe box of hopelessly confused notes

45
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,659
about cash payments to programmers
to young to be legally hired.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,510
To his credit, and
perhaps to counter Reagan's pessimism,

47
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,330
the auditor looked across at
the nervous teenage entrepreneur and

48
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,200
said, everything seems to be
in order here, Mr. Autrey.

49
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,820
But with emphasis, he also added,
do not let this happen again.

50
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,630
>> I think this tax story offers up a
pretty good segue to the whole subject of

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,210
employees.

52
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,770
When you pay other people to do work for
you, you are opening yourself up to

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,050
a whole nest of new regulations,
liabilities and taxes.

54
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,000
In some cases,
you maybe able to pay folks cash or

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,630
the equivalent in an agreed rate and
send them on their way.

56
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,340
However, if this amount exceeds
a certain limit in the United States,

57
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,390
the last time I checked it
was still under $1,000.

58
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,270
The American Internal Revenue Service
requires

59
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,375
you to send these contract workers
a 1099 form at the end of the year

60
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:37,085
to insure that they don't skip
out on paying their taxes.

61
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:40,695
The other possibility is you actually
hire some people as employees.

62
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:43,845
However once you do that, you are exposed
to a lot more rules involving

63
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,815
how they are paid, how much they are paid,

64
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:51,035
the number of hours they can work,
when they get breaks and a whole lot more.

65
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:54,820
Of course all of this is
too complex to review here.

66
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,500
But before you hire any employees,
research all of these rules.

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,370
Key tip here is, talk to an accountant.

68
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,280
And now on a similar note, let's
finish up this part of the lesson and

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,330
talk a bit about the various legal
forms you can choose for your business.

70
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,120
This is gonna vary widely depending
on what country you live in.

71
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,020
>> But here's the big point.

72
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,930
How you organize your enterprise in
a legal structure will have a big impact,

73
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,210
both on your own personal liability,
should something go wrong, and

74
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,330
the level of taxes you may have to pay.

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,040
>> So check out this angle carefully.

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,337
And if you're in the United States and
your business has any potential for

77
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:41,843
generating liability, you may wanna
consider the safety of either a regular

78
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:46,090
corporation or a limited liability
corporation, the so-called LLC.

79
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,000
>> Now, when you're ready,
please move on to Part 3 of this lesson.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
