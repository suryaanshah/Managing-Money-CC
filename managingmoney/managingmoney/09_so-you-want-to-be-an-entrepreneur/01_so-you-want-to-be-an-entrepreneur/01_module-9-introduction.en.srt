00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:09,713
Hi, Alex LeBon here.

3
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:10,582
>> And I'm Greg Archer,

4
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:13,980
I teach Entrepreneurship at
the University of Southern California.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,650
>> So, what brings you to our virtual
world today, Professor Archer?

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,800
Well Alex, I'm excited about what you and
Professor Navarro have been doing here.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,890
And I wanted to highlight some of the
really important financial opportunities

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,990
and pitfalls,
that young business owners face.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,930
>> Isn't someone like me a bit too
young to be starting a business?

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,440
>> Not at all,

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,890
in fact most entrepreneurs started early,
many of them in their teens.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,810
The problem is they often learn things,

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,960
including personal finance in
the school of hard knocks.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,730
>> But isn't it better to
just get my college degree,

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,930
get a good job and let other people
take the risks of running a business?

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,170
>> Well maybe if you could
in fact get that good job.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,740
>> However a lot of the problem here,
is that college grads are coming out of

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,690
school with a load of debt and
few prospects.

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,750
In fact, some studies have
suggested that about half of

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,480
American college graduates are taking jobs
that don't require a college education.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,510
And the average wage for graduates
isn't that far above minimum wage.

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,493
>> Okay, the idea of being
an entrepreneur is sounding better and

23
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:21,510
better, so how about we get started.

24
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,755
>> Well,
I'm ready when you're students are.

25
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:26,545
>> So off to part one,
you can go as soon as you want.
