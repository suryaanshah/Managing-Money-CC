1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,867
The moment you start charging people for
some product or service,

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:05,339
you've started a business.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,007
You might be mowing the neighbor's lawn or
maybe picking up stuff at yard sales and

4
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:11,168
listing it on eBay.

5
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:13,534
>> On the other hand,
you might have bigger ambitions and

6
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:16,630
be launching your own app on
the Apple App Store or Google Marketplace.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,010
>> Regardless of your choice,
you have already become an entrepreneur.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,050
And that has some
interesting implications for

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,110
your personal financial planning and
taxes.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,978
So, here's your first key tip.

11
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:31,174
>> If you're going to
be a business person,

12
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:35,271
you will need to establish relationships
with professionals you can trust.

13
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:39,099
At a minimum, you will need a banker,
an insurance agent,

14
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:42,010
an accountant, and a lawyer.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,200
But don't just choose
the one down the street.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,980
Or the first one you find when
you Google slick lawyer dude.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,010
Instead, I recommend you
find a business mentor.

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,470
Preferably an older person
who knows the ropes and

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,410
has some connections in your field or
your community.

20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,970
Who can introduce you to the network.

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,050
You might even consider going to
the local chamber of commerce and

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,970
introducing yourself.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,140
Regardless, always be alert to
incompetence and the scam artists.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,790
Now, as to why you need the help
of these professionals.

25
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,550
Let's work our way to some of the hurdles
you're gonna have to jump over and

26
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,880
start with the whole issue of liabilities.

27
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,820
When you start any business activity,
there's always the possibility that what

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,710
you're doing or how you do it will either
offend someone or fail to satisfy them.

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,120
Justifiably or not, they may seek
legal recourse, you could be sued.

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,340
When I say you, I mean you.

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,260
And this kind of liability can impact
your personal finances in a huge way.

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,270
As to how to assess your liability, it's
a truism that all businesses can generate

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,840
some liability, but it's the nature

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,980
of your business that ultimately defines
how much actual risk is involved.

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,400
On one hand,
if you launch a scrapbooking business,

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,180
your biggest fear might be that one of
your clients will suffer a paper cut.

37
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,240
Not a lot of risk there.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,370
On the other hand, if you start
up a document delivery service,

39
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,070
you could actually injure
someone in a car accident

40
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,400
rushing somewhere to
deliver that key document.

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,440
Just because there's more risk
doesn't mean you shouldn't pursue

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,149
the delivery business.

43
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,550
It just means you must be aware of
the liability you're creating and

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,790
consider ways you can reduce it and
to limit your personal exposure.

45
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,290
That's where both your accountant and
your lawyer can be useful.

46
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,410
Of course, the obvious way to reduce
your risk in the delivery business is to

47
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,770
drive carefully.

48
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,860
And it's always a good idea for any
business owner to establish a culture of

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,900
safety and to institute procedures
that will reduce accidents.

50
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,680
However, driving the speed limit and

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,940
stopping at every red light will
not prevent every accident.

52
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,190
And even if the other
person causes the crash,

53
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,730
a court could still easily find you
at least partially responsible.

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,930
Now here's another caution flag.

55
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,780
You could also be liable
if your product or

56
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,890
service doesn't live up to
the customer's expectations.

57
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,000
Moreover that liability could
exceed the cost of the good or

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
service you're actually providing.

59
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,560
Just imagine you're delivering
an important cashier's check for

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,519
a big big deal, and
you get caught in traffic.

61
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,380
Unfortunately that delay means you don't
get the check to where it needs to be on

62
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,260
time, and your client's important
business deal blows up.

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,410
The next thing you know, the person
who hired you is coming after you for

64
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,820
the million bucks she lost, not just the
$20 bucks she paid you for your service.

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,100
Now there are several things you can do to
make sure you don't spend the rest of your

66
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,610
life paying for
the consequences of one bad day.

67
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,900
One is choosing the right legal form for
your business,

68
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,400
which we'll be discussing shortly.

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,830
Another good idea is to make
sure you're properly insured.

70
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,400
I know Alex has already
discussed insurance, but

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,950
it's important that you talk to your
insurance agent about your planned

72
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,479
business activity and
get coverage before you engage in it.

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,840
As my final key tip for this part of
the lesson, please make sure you have in

74
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,770
place the appropriate written
agreements with your clients and

75
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,300
your vendors to make sure your liability
is limited to what you expect it to be.

76
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,840
>> Roger that, Professor Autry.

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,000
So, what are we going to tackle
in part two of the lesson?

78
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,729
>> Here's a clue, and it's a famous quote
from conservative president Ronald Reagan.

79
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,780
I've always felt that the nine most
terrifying words in the English language

80
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,360
are, I'm from the government and
I'm here to help.

81
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:30,956
>> So we'll be talking about regulations
and taxes for a small business then?

82
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:32,918
>> Exactly.

83
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:39,949
