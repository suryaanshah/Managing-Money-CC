[MUSIC] Hi, Alex LeBon here. >> And I'm Greg Archer, I teach Entrepreneurship at
the University of Southern California. >> So, what brings you to our virtual
world today, Professor Archer? Well Alex, I'm excited about what you and
Professor Navarro have been doing here. And I wanted to highlight some of the
really important financial opportunities and pitfalls,
that young business owners face. >> Isn't someone like me a bit too
young to be starting a business? >> Not at all, in fact most entrepreneurs started early,
many of them in their teens. The problem is they often learn things, including personal finance in
the school of hard knocks. >> But isn't it better to
just get my college degree, get a good job and let other people
take the risks of running a business? >> Well maybe if you could
in fact get that good job. >> However a lot of the problem here,
is that college grads are coming out of school with a load of debt and
few prospects. In fact, some studies have
suggested that about half of American college graduates are taking jobs
that don't require a college education. And the average wage for graduates
isn't that far above minimum wage. >> Okay, the idea of being
an entrepreneur is sounding better and better, so how about we get started. >> Well,
I'm ready when you're students are. >> So off to part one,
you can go as soon as you want. [MUSIC]
