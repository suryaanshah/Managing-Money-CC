1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,850
So you wanna buy a house.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,950
Unless you're related
to the Rockefellers or

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,620
a whiz kid entrepreneur that means you're
probably going to need a mortgage.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,700
In fact the home mortgage is one of
the most important loans out there.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,450
It allows you to move into a house without
requiring a huge amount of capital.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,270
As noted in part one of this lesson,
Mortgage is an amortizing loan with a long

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,050
payment term that makes the house you
purchase the collateral for the loan.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,200
So if you can't pay off the loan, the bank
can take possession of your house and

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,350
sell it to make its money back.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,740
When you first apply for a mortgage,

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,550
there will be many steps before
the money gets to your hands.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,140
The creditors will do a thorough credit
check to ensure your credit history

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,860
isn't abysmal.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,040
And from there, they'll begin
to shape the terms of the loan.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,010
A very important part of this
process is the appraisal.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,520
In this step,

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,260
a professional appraiser will estimate the
value of the house you want to mortgage.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,080
And in fact, this appraisal is an
important part of the system of checks and

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,310
balances.

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,239
If you've paid a price way above
the appraised value of the property,

21
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,510
you probably made a bad deal, and
the lender doesn't want any part of that.

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,828
In fact, a lot of lenders got into trouble
when this system of checks and balances

23
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:19,230
failed in the months leading up to the
bursting of the housing bubble in 2007.

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,630
The system failed because
the appraisers themselves.

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,560
Weren't doing their due diligence.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,190
They were just rubber stamping
properties at the selling price.

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,400
When the bubble burst and
prices dropped, lenders could only

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,120
sell the foreclosed houses for a loss,
and ended up suffering for it.

29
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,370
Since that market turmoil, lenders have
been very careful about their risk.

30
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,550
Appraisers have mostly cleaned up their
acts, and you are far more likely to get

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,800
an appraisal that underestimates the value
than one that overestimates the value.

32
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,030
Okay, back to our main story.

33
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,470
After the property's value has been
determined by the appraiser and

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,970
the lender evaluates your credit history,
if it all looks good,

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,340
you will have to decide between
two possible mortgage options.

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,170
On one hand, you can choose a fixed-rate
mortgage meaning that the interest rate on

37
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,930
your loan will stay the same
throughout the period.

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,020
Thus, if you get into the loan
while mortgage rates are low

39
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,820
then you time the economy well and

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,090
can now reap the benefits of a great
interest rate for the period of the loan.

41
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,000
Meanwhile the lender bears all the risks
that interest rates may rise above your

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,710
fixed rate and
you get to sleep well at night.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,280
In contrast, the bank can offer you an
adjustable or variable rate mortgage that

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,590
sometimes starts off with a lower
teaser rate to draw you in.

45
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,630
But here's a big note of caution.

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,910
An adjustable rate mortgage is
much more of a gambler's loan.

47
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,470
While the adjustable rate is tied to
the prevailing interest rate at the time,

48
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,160
if the interest rates rise over time,
so too will your mortgage payments.

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,750
And if interest rates go sky high and
you can't pay your mortgage,

50
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,210
note that interest rate have gone
as high as 20% or more in the past,

51
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,720
you may wind up in foreclosure with
no home, bad credit, and the loss of

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,230
all your original down payment and
any more equity you may have in the home.

53
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,170
You can see then why lenders like to
entice you into adjustable rate mortgages.

54
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,550
They basically shift all the risk of
rising rates right onto your shoulders,

55
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,880
and you may not sleep as well at night.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,950
Now here's another big caution flag,

57
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,510
because adjustable-rate mortgages tend to
have initially slightly lower rates than

58
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,800
fixed mortgages, precisely because
lenders are assuming a lot less risk.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,090
A lot of folks are tempted by
adjustable rate mortgages.

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,480
My advice however is that,
if you plan to be in the home for

61
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,260
any extended period as opposed
to flipping it quickly,

62
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,780
you are almost always better
off with a fixed-rate mortgage.

63
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,280
The reason?

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,500
You can always refinance a fixed-rate
mortgage to take advantage of falling

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,860
interest rates, and thereby keep
the risk on the lenders rather than you.

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,380
Just what do I mean by
refinancing your mortgage?

67
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,730
Here's how it works.

68
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,050
With a refi, as they say in the biz, you
basically trade in your old mortgage for

69
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,270
a new one with a lower interest rate,
maybe even better terms.

70
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,140
And one of the reasons I'm highlighting
this is that when you get your

71
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,920
original mortgage you should be very,
very sure there is no pre-payment

72
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,730
penalty that would make
the cost of a refi prohibitive.

73
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,360
In fact, since mortgages involve
relatively large sums of money,

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,850
even small drops in mortgage rates,
as little as half of a percentage point,

75
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,810
can save you a nice chunk of
change on your monthly payments.

76
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,900
So do keep an active eye on interest
rates as a homeowner and take control

77
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,090
of your financial destiny by using
refinancing when the situation warrants.

78
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,360
Now, here's one last wrinkle
in the mortgage game.

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,190
Mortgage Insurance.

80
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,205
If you want to buy a home and

81
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:58,100
wants to put less than a certain amount
down, currently 20% in the United States,

82
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,410
the lender will require you to
purchase mortgage insurance.

83
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,010
And as part of your monthly payments,

84
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,720
you'll be required to pay
the premiums on that insurance.

85
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,180
Of course the advantage of
mortgage insurance is that

86
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,150
it allows you to buy a home
with a smaller down payment.

87
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,790
That might get you into your
first new home a lot quicker.

88
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,000
However, as I warned you
in an earlier lesson,

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,910
if you screw up your credit score
through bad behavior, or maybe bad luck.

90
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,480
You won't be able to qualify for
mortgage insurance.

91
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,173
You will be shut out of
the home buying market,

92
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:33,880
not least until you
accumulate more capital.

93
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,170
That's just another reason to keep your
web of personal finance cozy and secure.

94
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,361
Now on to part three when you're ready,
and

95
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:44,040
we'll take a look at some of
the other types of loans.

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:52,009
