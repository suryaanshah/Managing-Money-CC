1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,310
In part two of this lesson,
we focused on home mortgages.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,410
And the specific things to expect
when going through what's called

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,425
the underwriting process.

4
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,960
When the terms of the loan are decided.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,810
Now it's time to take a look at the
specifics of some other types of loans and

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,260
how they differ.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,280
Let's start with auto loans.

8
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:22,630
Lending instrument you will likely
use one of more times in your life.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,390
In fact, the first big decision you
have to make about a car loan is

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,230
whether to get one at all.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,100
What I mean is that you might have enough
savings to pay the full amount for

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,990
a new or used car.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,760
But if you do that you won't
have that capital to invest

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,840
maybe earn a higher rate of return.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,808
Than the interest rate
you're paying on the loan.

16
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:49,730
This trade off is what we economists call
the opportunity cost of the car loan.

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,510
Because you are losing the opportunity
to make money in other investments

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,610
with your capital.

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,730
The concept of opportunity
cost extends to many

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,120
other concepts in personal finance and
economics.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,760
But car loans are a good example
to demonstrate this key idea.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,850
As for negotiating a car loan,
should you opt for that.

23
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,380
There are two basic ways to go about it.

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,770
One way is to go directly to your bank or
credit union or

25
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,600
some other lending institution.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,970
To apply for
a loan before you go to the dealers.

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,440
This lets you shop round for
terms and compare rates.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,770
It also lets you know your
credit terms in advance.

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,320
Alternatively, you can get financing
straight from the car dealer.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,900
In this case,
you agree to pay the car off.

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,800
And the dealer will either keep
the contract and collect your payments.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,500
Or it will sell the contract off to
a creditor so they can get their money.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,690
This route is not only convenient
If you trade in your old car.

34
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,780
It can count towards a down
payment on the loan.

35
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,650
Plus, if you still owe
money on the old car.

36
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,960
You can include the rest of the payments
into the financing deal on the new car.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,970
The biggest advantage of getting a loan
directly from the dealer, however.

38
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,580
Is that it lets you take advantage of any
special financing programs available from

39
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,860
the dealer or the manufacturer.

40
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,100
Most car dealers shamelessly use this
particular hook to sell you a car.

41
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,850
But here is one big catch.

42
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,490
In order to take part in
some of the better deals,

43
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,250
you simply have to have good credit,
and here's a key tip.

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,330
You should know your credit score
before you go into a car dealership.

45
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,760
If it's a good score, you can then
really bargain through strength.

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,380
As a final tip,
it is wise to look into warranties,

47
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,920
especially if you are going
to be financing your new car.

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,780
It would be a big financial
hit to end up with

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,270
a lemon of a car that
you still owe money on.

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,760
And not have it covered by the warranty.

51
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,890
Now before we move away from auto loans.

52
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,500
I would be remiss in failing to note that,
if you want to drive a new car.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,290
One alternative way to do that
is to sign a lease on the car.

54
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,800
You still will have a monthly
payment on the car for

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,990
the period of the lease,
usually three to five years.

56
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,020
And that payment will be smaller
than the typical car loan, so

57
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,260
you can get a more expensive car to drive.

58
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,110
The big downside,

59
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,790
however, is that at the end of the lease,
as opposed to the end of your loan.

60
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,440
The car goes back to the leaseholder and
you don't own anything.

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Sometimes, however, there are terms.

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,030
That let you buy the car at a somewhat
reduced price at the end of the lease.

63
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,205
Dealer gets to dictate the price
in most cases, so be careful.

64
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,150
You might not get a good deal.

65
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,260
Leasing is an interesting choice.

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,920
So if you are tempted to go in that
direction, please do a bunch of research.

67
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,340
All I can say is that you are usually
better off buying rather than

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,900
leasing over the long term.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,460
Moving away from auto-loans,

70
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,040
there are also things called
debt consolidation loans.

71
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,470
With a debt consolidation loan,

72
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,280
you round up all the money
you owe on your credit card.

73
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,110
The electric utility company and
so on, total that debt up.

74
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,890
And then borrow that amount in the form
of one loan and get your bills clear.

75
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,120
A big advantage is that you
only have one bill to pay.

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,010
An often bigger advantage is
that you can replace the much

77
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,470
higher interest rates you
pay on credit card debt.

78
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,170
With a much lower rate.

79
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,100
But just be very sure you're going
to be able to handle the payments.

80
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,720
Otherwise, you are just exchanging
one problem for another.

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,180
And be even more sure that you
don't get sucked into the vortex

82
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,270
of exorbitant credit card interest.

83
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,300
By running up your balances again.

84
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,690
That's where sound budgeting comes in.

85
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,050
Now, the last type of loan I'd like to
talk about is the standard line of credit.

86
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,330
Even though line of credit is used like
an umbrella term for most loans nominally.

87
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,270
It is a loan where the bank grants
you a block of money in an account.

88
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,540
You only pay interest on the money
you withdraw from the account.

89
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,980
And here's a cautionary note.

90
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,740
If you don't use the line
of credit very much,

91
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,120
the bank might charge
you a fee of some sort.

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,270
So be aware of that.

93
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,280
So here's the bottom line.

94
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,130
Loans have lots of complexities and

95
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,080
small details that you'll
need to research yourself.

96
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
It's the proverbial fine print.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,010
And, yep,
the devil is indeed often in the details.

98
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,500
So take what I've shared
with you as a baseline.

99
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,650
But know that it's incredibly important
to read all the terms on the contract.

100
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,330
As they might fundamentally
change the way the loan behaves.

101
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,080
And that you need to be aware
of cases where that happens.

102
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,110
But all in all loans
are a very positive thing, and

103
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,220
could be very helpful if you
manage them the right way.

104
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,040
They have there place in
a sound financial plan.

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,870
But you have to be smart an responsible
when you are using these tools.

106
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,948
Remember it's all about having
a smart plan and being in control.

107
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:45,948
