00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:09,599
Hi, I'm Prof Navarro.

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,015
>> And I'm Alex LeBon.

4
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:13,336
>> All right, so what's on tap today?

5
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:15,681
>> Loans, loans, and more loans.

6
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,200
>> What kinda loans are we talking about?

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,360
>> Well you name it, we will cover it.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,310
Mortgages, auto loans,
lines of credit, you get the picture.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,560
>> All right, what's our big take away?

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,600
>> Simply,
that if you understand the loan process.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,390
You'll get into that first home and
fast car.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,940
And whatever else you have your eye on.

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,210
A lot faster than if you
are loan illiterate.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,190
>> And, as I understand it,
a lot of it is a vernacular game.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,240
>> Right.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,770
You need to know about stuff like down
payments, amortization schedules,

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,310
annuity formulas, liquidity, the really
big difference between fixed and

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,110
adjustable rate mortgages.

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,410
>> All right, that actually
sounds pretty interesting, but

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,750
before I turn you loose for
part one, can I ask you something?

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,454
>> Sure.

22
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:05,983
>> Can you lend me a few
bucks to my next paycheck?

23
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,724
>> Got any collateral?

24
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,443
>> Why do you ask?

25
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:12,299
>> You'll have to view
the lesson to find out.

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,041
>> All right, off we go.
