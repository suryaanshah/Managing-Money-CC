1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,830
Lenders aren't necessarily your friends.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,050
We've established as much in our last
couple of lectures about credit.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,560
The fact is, lenders are in business to
make a profit, and your role as a consumer

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,390
is to make sure that you get what you need
from them for the lowest possible cost.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,290
In fact,
that's what makes an efficient market.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,610
Profit maximizing businesses of course but
cautious, careful consumers like you doing

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,470
their due diligence are the other key
ingredient necessary for a good market.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,660
So what about the market for

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,020
one of the most important services
of financial institutions?

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,810
I'm talking about loans.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,320
All kinds of loans.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,750
Home mortgages, car loans,
personal lines of credit, business loans,

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,010
you're going to need to tangle with
these things throughout your life,

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,430
because they're useful financial tools.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,890
In fact, by having access to
capital through the loan process,

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,440
you will be empowered to make
large purchases like houses and

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,570
cars without having to accumulate
unreasonable amounts of money,

18
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,310
or liquid capital as
they call it in the biz.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,400
So it is important for
you to understand how loans work and

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,360
how to incorporate them into
a smart financial plan.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,760
For starters, many loans
are structured with a down payment.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,270
This is usually some smaller
portion of the purchase price for

23
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,280
whatever you might be buying.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,475
For example, to buy a house costing,
let's say, $500,000.

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,750
You may only have to put up a $50,000 or
$100,000 dollar down payment.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,060
I say only here because
you see how hard it might

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,840
be to come up with
the full half a million.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,150
But if you save diligently,
remember our budgeting tips from Lesson 1,

29
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,390
50 grand might be doable.

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,230
As to why you have to even
bother with a down payment,

31
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,400
in colloquial bank vernacular
it's called skin in the game.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,270
It's the amount of money, your so

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,880
called equity, that you would lose
if you defaulted on the loan.

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,760
And by having such, skin in the game,

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:10,030
or equity, the lender's figure you
are less likely to default on the loan.

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,800
Plus, the down payment
helps serve as proof that

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,430
you have a sound financial situation.

38
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,880
Now, the next thing you need to know,

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,730
is that the schedule payments you have on
many loans Include two main components.

40
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,640
Some repayment of the principal
to pay down the loan, and

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,710
some payment of interest to cover
your ongoing borrowing costs.

42
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,210
Just what is the principal?

43
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,520
That's the amount you actually borrowed
to begin with from the bank or lender.

44
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,130
As for the interest, that's what the
lender charges you on the borrowed money.

45
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,980
Interest can be fixed the starting time
of the loan or it can be variable and

46
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,700
adjusted to mirror the market at certain
intervals to your benefit or loss.

47
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,030
In the home mortgage market,

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,890
these two types of loans are called
fixed verses variable rate loans.

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,950
More about that later, because the choice
between which to use is very important.

50
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,050
Now there are a bunch of different
kinds of loans in the marketplace, but

51
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,650
one main type is the so-called
amortizing loan.

52
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,400
If you go to a site like Investopedia,

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,150
amortization will be defined
something like this.

54
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,440
The paying off of debt with a fixed
repayment schedule in regular installments

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,550
over a period of time.

56
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,840
For example, for a car loan, it will
be for a fixed period such as 3, 5, or

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,300
even 7 years.

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,150
Over that period, you will likely have

59
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,790
a fixed monthly payment that remains the
same over the entire period of the loan.

60
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,360
That's the regular installments
part of the definition.

61
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,720
The broader point here is
that through amortization

62
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,440
you'll pay a portion of the principle and
a portion of the interest and

63
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,470
thereby steadily whittle down the amount
you owe until you make the last payment.

64
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,250
As for
how the fixed payments are calculated

65
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,080
that's done through what is
called an annuity formula.

66
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,630
Technically an annuity,

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,000
say within the context of home
mortgage maybe defined as a fixed sum

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,220
payable at specified intervals over
a period in return for a single payment.

69
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,120
In this case, the bank pays you the fixed
sum in the form of the loan upfront and

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,640
over time, you pay them a fixed sum
broken up into monthly payments.

71
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,210
To figure out what that fixed sum is,

72
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,510
an annuity formula is used that takes
into account both the principle and

73
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,430
the interest on that principle
that must be paid over time.

74
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,290
You'll learn more about how that formula
actually works in other courses,

75
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,190
such as those in accounting,
economics or finance.

76
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,460
But for now you can see,
using this mortgage calculator.

77
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,650
How sensitive your monthly payments
will be to the rate of interest.

78
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:02,381
And here's something really interesting,
about an amortizing loan,

79
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,410
like a home mortgage.

80
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,500
At the beginning of the loan,

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,640
most of your monthly payment is to pay-off
the interest while as the loan matures,

82
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,690
the fraction of the principal you'll
pay down each month will grow larger.

83
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,980
Of course, the lenders like it this way
because this type of amortization schedule

84
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,470
keeps you more committed to
the full term of the loan.

85
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,900
Now here's a big caution flag.

86
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,720
There are also so called Negative
Amortization schemes that allow you to

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,170
defer paying interest for a short
time at the beginning of your loan.

88
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,650
While this type of scheme helps
you lower your initial payments.

89
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,850
The interest you don't pay off for that
initial period gets added to your balance.

90
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,650
Of course, in the end, you wind up
paying more money over the long run.

91
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,760
And that observation leads
us to this key point.

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,340
If you have to resort to a negative
amortization payment scheme

93
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,370
to afford your loan payments,
you might wanna reconsider your finances.

94
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,720
Sure you'll make the lower monthly
payments for a short time.

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,540
But when your full payments kick in you
could get into trouble as you have to

96
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,970
start paying interest and have higher
monthly payments on the principle.

97
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,090
In fact, these types of schemes
are part of the problem that

98
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,780
lead to the collapse of home prices
in the 2007 financial crisis

99
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,980
because they had much higher rates of
default than traditional mortgages.

100
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,900
Now, here's a final bit of loan
terminology we need to deal with.

101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,090
The idea of collateral and it's
basically the thing of value you put up

102
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,010
to get a loan and
stand to lose if you default on the loan.

103
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,490
Again, the idea here is that you have
less incentive to walk away from a loan

104
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,160
if you have something of value to lose.

105
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,360
Of course for

106
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,960
home mortgage your collateral is the house
you actually buy with the money.

107
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,860
Default on your loan in the home
becomes the property of the bank or

108
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,730
the financial institution
holding the paper on that loan.

109
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,140
In other words, you lose your collateral.

110
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,273
Similarly, for auto loans,
the collateral is the car you buy.

111
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:08,400
Default on the loan, and the repo
man may pay your driveway a visit.

112
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,040
We'll cover mortgages and other good
stuff in part two of this lesson.

113
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,507
Move on when you're ready.

114
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:23,729
