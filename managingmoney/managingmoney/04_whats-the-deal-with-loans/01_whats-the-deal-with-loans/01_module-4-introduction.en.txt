[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Prof Navarro. >> And I'm Alex LeBon. >> All right, so what's on tap today? >> Loans, loans, and more loans. >> What kinda loans are we talking about? >> Well you name it, we will cover it. Mortgages, auto loans,
lines of credit, you get the picture. >> All right, what's our big take away? >> Simply,
that if you understand the loan process. You'll get into that first home and
fast car. And whatever else you have your eye on. A lot faster than if you
are loan illiterate. >> And, as I understand it,
a lot of it is a vernacular game. >> Right. You need to know about stuff like down
payments, amortization schedules, annuity formulas, liquidity, the really
big difference between fixed and adjustable rate mortgages. >> All right, that actually
sounds pretty interesting, but before I turn you loose for
part one, can I ask you something? >> Sure. >> Can you lend me a few
bucks to my next paycheck? >> Got any collateral? >> Why do you ask? >> You'll have to view
the lesson to find out. >> All right, off we go. [MUSIC]
