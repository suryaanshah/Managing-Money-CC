1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,970
I mean everybody's got a budget.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,900
We live on a budget.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,900
We believe the government ought to live
on the same budget, live on a budget.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,425
Not change it from what, you know,
we're just gonna keep adding to the debt.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,230
>> Okay.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,950
Now let's get down to
the basics of budgeting.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,170
And like the man in the video clip says,

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,920
everybody has to keep to a personal
budget, even when our government is

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,830
spending money like a drunken sailor and
racking up huge deficits.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,770
You on the other hand just can't do that.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,200
So let's get a little more academic and

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,690
formal now about how we want to
think about the budgeting process.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,096
Here's the basic model you
want to build everything from.

14
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:42,500
Money in, money out.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,000
And in the middle we have a sector
representing our various cash reserves,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,990
savings and investing accounts.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,280
Now, here's the essence of the model.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,510
To make a good plan you have to account
for all your money flowing in and

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,670
flowing out.

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,590
This will affect what
you do with the money or

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,910
discretionary funds you have in
the middle that you can control.

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,370
So, let's start in our
model with Money In.

23
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,390
At this point in your life, your money
in column is likely to be pretty simple.

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,510
It may be your pay check from work.

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,030
May be an allowance from your
parent if you're still in school.

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,040
Maybe a little extra cash on the side if
you make money through a hobby, like I do.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,670
I have a part time gig as
a professional sand sculptor.

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,700
Building sand castles for
things like weddings and corporate events.

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,200
As for other possible money in-flows,
as you acquire capital and

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,170
invest it to put that money to work,
your Money In column should expand

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,700
to also include the gains from
the investments you've made.

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,740
Now, how about the Money Out column?

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,780
Well, the first thing that we want to do
is identify our fixed expenses each month.

34
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,600
Those are generally the recurring expenses
that have to be the first thing we pay.

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,320
As a college student, these fixed
expenses might include things like rent,

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,210
groceries, utilities, a phone bill and
transportation costs.

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,890
As I said,
these are the bare bones essentials, or

38
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,100
necessities we need to continue to
survive and get to work on time.

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,130
It's the money out that
is already spoken for

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,370
each month as soon as it
gets into your hands.

41
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,340
Now here's where things
really get interesting.

42
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,810
That's because the difference
between these two money in and

43
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,180
money out cashflow streams will be the
discretionary funds you have to work with

44
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,780
each month to either consume for
fun or invest for a future return.

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,305
In fact, it is with this
accounting reality that the fun or

46
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:41,160
self-restraint begins.

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,220
That is, you can either blow all that
discretionary income on fun stuff

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,130
every month, or you can just spend
some of it and save the rest.

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,840
So, let's assume that your
goal is to have a smart plan.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,440
Like Juanita from our fable.

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,590
What do you do to start
executing that plan?

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,200
Well a great first step is to open up
a savings account at your local bank

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
or a credit union.

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,950
Such a savings account will be handy for

55
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,600
building up an emergency reserve of money
or for saving up for large purchases.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,790
Plus, savings accounts have the added
benefit that they typically earn more

57
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,610
interest than checking accounts.

58
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,440
And have lower fees.

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,900
But, at the same time that
you open a savings account,

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,800
you may want to open
a checking account as well.

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,210
That's because savings accounts often
have low transaction limits per month.

62
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,980
Mine is only allowed six transactions per
month which is only really useful for

63
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,660
transferring and depositing funds,
not making purchases.

64
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,500
And two tips here.

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,190
First I'm a big fan of credit unions.

66
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,590
As they tend to be friendlier places and

67
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,280
offer slightly higher interest
rates as a rule than regular banks.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,430
In fact as a college student you may
want to see if your university has its

69
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,000
own credit union.

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,500
Second and
this is an important caution flag.

71
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,400
Not all checking accounts are equal.

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,300
That is,
some banks charge higher fees than others.

73
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,260
More subtly, some banks brag that
they won't charge you a fee if you

74
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,480
keep a minimum monthly balance.

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,370
However, with a minimum balance, you
do wind up paying a hidden cost because

76
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,980
you earn less interest on the balance.

77
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,620
Or maybe no interest at all.

78
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,755
So, before you open your brand new
savings and checking accounts,

79
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:31,550
shop around to get the best rate based on
the number of checks you think you'll need

80
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,550
to write each month.

81
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:40,979
