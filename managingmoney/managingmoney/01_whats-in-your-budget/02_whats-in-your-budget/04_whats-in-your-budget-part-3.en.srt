1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,700
Okay.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,300
Now, that we've got the idea
of money in and money out, and

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,660
some discretionary funds
each month to play with.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,670
Let's make a sample budget for
a typical month.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,380
We'll start with the inflows and
outflows, and categorize them.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,040
Then, we can look at where we can set
goals, and how to go about meeting them.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,200
So, let's say we have an income
of $2000 every month.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,500
That represents our money in.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,254
From that, we need to subtract $800 for
rent and utilities, $50 for

10
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:39,310
a phone bill, $200 for
transportation, and $350 for food.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,940
After paying these fixed expenses,

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,210
that leaves us with $600 of
money to work with, not a lot.

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,360
Still, let's put aside maybe
$400 as spending money, and

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,726
the other $200 we can save.

15
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:57,678
And, from those savings,
we can make a goal,

16
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:02,239
at least conceptually in our minds,
to put some away for an emergency.

17
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,599
And, some away for a large purchase
like a nice vacation, or a new car,

18
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,820
or something of the sort.

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,630
And, here's the key point.

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,210
If we spend all the discretionary money
we have every month, larger planned

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,350
purchases, that new computer, or
car, become much more difficult.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,330
Plus, if you don't save, and you run
into an emergency, like a bad accident,

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,305
or losing your job,
that can have big financial consequences,

24
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:31,385
both in the near and longer term.

25
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,240
Just ask Juan from our fable.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,080
Now, even though this is a pretty decent
example of a monthly budget, you,

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,990
of course, need to set your own goals,
and develop your spending plans.

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,760
In fact, one thing we are not going to
do in this course is to tell you how to

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,480
actually use your money.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,110
That's up to you.

31
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,408
Nor are we going to encourage
you to live like a miser either.

32
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:56,010
Our view is that money
is meant to be spent.

33
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,800
But, like so many things in life
where timing is critical, when and

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,570
how you spend your discretionary
money will largely determine how your

35
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,220
wealth may, or may not grow over time.

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,000
So, getting back to our main
budgeting task, just remember,

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,550
in your budgetary accounting,
that you must start by accounting for

38
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,510
your necessary and unavoidable costs, like
utilities and rent, maybe a car payment,

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,330
and then work from there.

40
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,560
And on that note, I think it is
also important to acknowledge that

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,380
there are actually lots of discretionary
elements in what we've listed so

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,800
far as necessary and unavoidable costs.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,320
For example, your rent or mortgage is
initially determined by how big or

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,830
small of an apartment, or
house you rent or buy.

45
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,100
So, if you are flexible initially,
and are willing to settle for

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,590
a smaller place a little farther
away from the transit line,

47
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,860
your fixed monthly costs for
housing will be lower.

48
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,520
And, you will have more discretionary
funds to play or invest with.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,170
Similarly, on the food front,
sure, you gotta eat.

50
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,920
But, maybe you can save more
money by making your own lunch.

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,540
Or, cutting down on that morning
mocha that is costing you close to

52
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,550
a 100 dollars a month.

53
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,710
Again, you don't have to pinch pennies,

54
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,680
but having a plan to save at least
some of you income is best practice.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,890
Let's finish up now with
a discussion of some handy tools for

56
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,610
you to begin to acquaint yourself with.

57
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,190
At a minimum, you can devise your
own custom excel spreadsheet

58
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,290
to prepare your monthly budget, and

59
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,250
that's an exercise we'd like you to
do once you finish this lecture.

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,660
But, there are also some handy web
tools out there that may be useful.

61
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,590
For example, this is a spreadsheet
from CollegeinColorado.org.

62
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,667
It's a pretty detailed expenses list,

63
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:46,280
and it allows you to download your
entries onto an Excel spreadsheet.

64
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:02,905
While all of these tools may be useful,
you also have to remember the first and

65
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:04,809
most important rule of budgeting.

66
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,690
The real challenge you're gonna face is
not making up your budget to begin with,

67
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,850
bur rather sticking to it.

68
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,610
So remember, the foundation of a smart
plan for our money is a simple budget.

69
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,650
From there, everything else
in the plan falls into place.

70
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,030
Mastering this elementary concept
will help you down the road,

71
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,490
when juggling multiple investments,
accounts, and revenue streams.

72
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,650
And, that's what managing
your money is all about.
