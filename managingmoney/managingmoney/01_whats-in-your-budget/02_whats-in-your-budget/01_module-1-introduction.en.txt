[MUSIC] Hi, Professor Navarro here. >> And I'm Alex LeBon. >> Okay Alex,
what's the mission in this first lecture? >> Well, I want to start off with
a brief overview of how the ten individual pieces of our course are all
going to fit together as a whole. >> Okay, what's the big takeaway? >> Well, simply that this is not
a course with a linear progression like many college courses. Instead, each of the topics we will cover
comprise more of a interrelated network, a spider web of personal finance,
if you will. >> Spider web? Spoken like a true physics major. >> Well, that's my thing. >> Okay, after the broad overview,
what will be the other key points? >> Well, after you get through paying for
your necessities, you at least hopefully will have some
discretionary money left over each month. And that's where you need a smart plan. >> Okay, what's that mean? What's a smart plan entail? >> Well, usually a smart plan means
weighing the fun you can have today consuming against the investing
you can do to grow your wealth for the tomorrows that will be coming. >> That doesn't sound like a lot of fun. >> Well, I never promised you a rose
garden, only a path to greater prosperity. >> We're good.
Any other key points before we get started? >> Yep, for some folks, it is going to be a lot easier making up
a budget than actually sticking to it. So be realistic and
be disciplined, grasshopper. >> [LAUGH] Okay, zen master,
let's get started. [MUSIC]
