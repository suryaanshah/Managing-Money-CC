1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,170
Here in lesson one, I wanna start
right off with the big picture

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,310
of how all ten lessons in this
course are going to fit together.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:13,200
At the same time, I wanna give you a solid
idea of the core theme behind the course.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,430
On the first question,

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,830
in most classes, the content
builds in a linear progression.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,930
For example, in math you first
learn an addition and subtraction.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,200
This in turn enables you to learn about
multiplication, and division, and so

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,390
on until you reach the dreaded, or
for some like me beloved calculus.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,870
For this course however, the content isn't
quite suited to such a linear structure.

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,590
Thus, while we've tried our best to
advance things in a logical order,

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,810
you will see that each
individual topic we cover

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,250
has multiple connections to
many of the other topics.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,570
For example, our first lesson here on
budgeting has multiple connections to our

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,350
lessons on credit cards, loans,
taxes, investment and so forth.

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,640
So it's kind of like a spider web of
personal finance rather than a ladder.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,980
And here's the key point, and

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,440
the main reason why I'm bothering to
share this course architecture with you.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,180
As you go sequentially through
the lessons, when something comes up that

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,660
references an earlier lesson, I encourage
you to go back to that topical lecture and

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,940
refresh your memory if you need to.

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,860
Now, here's another key point.

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,790
Despite the somewhat distributed
nature of the topics,

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,590
there is really only one
main theme to this course.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,920
Personal finance isn't like that bio 101
test that you're pretty sure you can wing

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,830
and still maybe get a decent grade.

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,070
Having a smart plan for
your money is very important, and

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,050
learning how to develop such a smart
plan at this stage of your life

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,950
lays the groundwork for the rest of
your personal and professional life.

29
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,300
Let me illustrate this point
with my very own modern fable,

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,490
reminiscent of the ant and
the grasshopper involving 2 30 something

31
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,680
executives at a medium sized company
that develops office buildings.

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,830
Neither of these executives,
we'll call them Juan and

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,670
Juanita, are in the 1% of the wealthy,
but both make pretty decent money.

34
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,930
So each month, they have a surplus
of discretionary funds to

35
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,620
allocate after they have covered their
fixed expenses like housing and insurance.

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,768
On one hand,
Juanita has a very smart financial plan.

37
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:26,510
She saves 5% of her paycheck every month,
invests wisely in the stock market,

38
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,340
and even own a small internet
business she runs on the side.

39
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,250
As a result,
she has multiple streams of income

40
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,170
as well as a decent amount of capital
in her business and other investments.

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,800
While she doesn't appear
to be super wealthy,

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,460
she drives a ten year old Toyota Camry
with a car loan long paid off.

43
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,770
She can support her family and
still live a reasonably comfortable life.

44
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,995
Juan on the other hand, lives as well as
he can off the wages he gets from work,

45
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,430
his only source of income.

46
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,110
Part of his cash flow drain
is a big lease payment

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,870
each month on a really cool red Porsche.

48
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,800
Plus the dude loves to party,
what can I say.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,900
So what do you think happens
when a mutual friend of Juan and

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,150
Juanita offer them a great opportunity
to invest in a new business venture

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,030
with a high probability of success?

52
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,510
While Juanita can take full
advantage of this opportunity,

53
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,750
Juan is simply tapped out.

54
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,790
Fast forward five years, and
the economy has gone into a recession.

55
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,300
The building industry is on the ropes and
both Juan and Juanita get laid off.

56
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,370
While Juan ends up on
the extended unemployment line,

57
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,740
riding the bus after missing several
lease payments on his latest Porsche,

58
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,560
Juanita simply devotes more
time to her side business and

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,480
draws a little bit of cash from her
other investments when she needs to.

60
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,440
Fast forward 20 more years, and Juanita is
off to an active retirement in Florida.

61
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,300
Juan on the other hand, has come to
the uncomfortable conclusion that

62
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,280
he will likely have to work well
into his supposed retirement.

63
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,309
So what are the key points?

64
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,360
Well, first, having a smart,
balanced plan let's us live

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,140
a more comfortable life at the same time
that it prepares us for emergencies,

66
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,490
bad economic trends, or investment
opportunities that may lie in the future.

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,550
Second, planning for the unexpected
emergency, like losing your job,

68
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,720
is as critical a part of your financial
plan as your investment portfolio.

69
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,860
And finally,

70
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,150
a key part of any smart financial plan
is diversifying your sources of income.

71
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,010
While Juan was stuck in
a highly cyclical industry and

72
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,380
paid a heavy price when a recession hit,

73
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,650
Juanita was appropriately diversified both
job-wise and through her investments.

74
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,680
You don't need to worry about the
specifics of diversification right now.

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,610
We will talk about that
in a later lecture.

76
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,274
For now, I just wanted to tell you this
little story to illustrate several of

77
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:52,820
the key ideas of the course, and

78
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,275
give you a small example of what
a smart financial plan might look like.

79
