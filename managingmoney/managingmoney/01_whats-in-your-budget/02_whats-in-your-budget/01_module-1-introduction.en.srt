00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:12,542
Hi, Professor Navarro here.

3
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,900
>> And I'm Alex LeBon.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,669
>> Okay Alex,
what's the mission in this first lecture?

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,310
>> Well, I want to start off with
a brief overview of how the ten

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,500
individual pieces of our course are all
going to fit together as a whole.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,540
>> Okay, what's the big takeaway?

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,940
>> Well, simply that this is not
a course with a linear progression

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,230
like many college courses.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,480
Instead, each of the topics we will cover
comprise more of a interrelated network,

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,710
a spider web of personal finance,
if you will.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,600
>> Spider web?

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,100
Spoken like a true physics major.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,400
>> Well, that's my thing.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,360
>> Okay, after the broad overview,
what will be the other key points?

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,100
>> Well, after you get through paying for
your necessities,

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,980
you at least hopefully will have some
discretionary money left over each month.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,080
And that's where you need a smart plan.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,860
>> Okay, what's that mean?

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,050
What's a smart plan entail?

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,990
>> Well, usually a smart plan means
weighing the fun you can have today

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,670
consuming against the investing
you can do to grow your wealth for

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,000
the tomorrows that will be coming.

24
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,640
>> That doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,750
>> Well, I never promised you a rose
garden, only a path to greater prosperity.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,590
>> We're good.
Any other

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,960
key points before we get started?

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,120
>> Yep, for some folks,

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,060
it is going to be a lot easier making up
a budget than actually sticking to it.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,945
So be realistic and
be disciplined, grasshopper.

31
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:37,297
>> [LAUGH] Okay, zen master,
let's get started.
