00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,817
Hi, I'm Peter Navarro and
I'll be your professor for

2
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:06,876
this course on managing your time,
money and career.

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:11,826
I've been a professor at UC Irvine
business school here in Sunny California,

4
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:16,326
for over 25 years, and I'm delighted
to be able to share with you some

5
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:20,170
insights about personal finance and
management.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,380
Usually reserve for my MBA students.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,100
>> And I'm Alex LeBon.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm an undergraduate student majoring
in physics that experienced firsthand

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,300
most of the issues and problems we're
going to be talking about in this course.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,011
You will be seeing and hearing me
throughout the video lessons, and

11
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:41,071
I will be helping explain and
translate the business and

12
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:45,520
economics concepts from Professor Navarro
to your everyday lives as a student.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,401
>> Here then is the deal.

14
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:52,480
This course is designed to
be both practical and fun.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,973
And it should be a very
low stress experience.

16
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:59,779
>> If you simply view the online lectures
a couple of times, take the quizzes,

17
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:04,450
You should get a very high rate of
return on this educational investment.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,280
>> As for the topics you will be studying,
they range from budgeting, borrowing and

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,060
credit score management to saving and

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,400
investing, insurance, taxes and
even entrepreneurship.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,920
>> And one note about the content.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,860
In most of your classes, the lessons will
be structured in a clear progression where

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,290
each lesson builds on the next as the
material becomes more and more difficult.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,040
But that's not what we will be doing here.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,160
>> That's right, Alex.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,330
Each of the lessons in this class more or
less stand on their own.

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,160
But they are also highly related to
at least some of the other lessons,

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,190
as if in a web.

29
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,900
>> For example,

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,390
in one lesson we'll teach the concept
of having a plan for your money.

31
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,350
But in other lessons we will
show you related concepts like

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,270
investment strategies and credit.

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,780
>> So keep that in mind while you're
going through the lessons, and

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,910
don't be afraid to go back to
lessons to keep your knowledge fresh

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,780
when we reference a particular
subject outside of it's lesson.

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,450
>> And here's my first key tip for you.

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,870
One of the most powerful
things about a Coursera course

38
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,180
is the community discussion forums.

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,980
>> That's right, be sure to post
your questions, personal insights or

40
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,510
additional related resources.

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,840
While Alex and
I cannot answer all of your questions,

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,380
the vast community of learners in
the course can help fill that gap.

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,820
And you will benefit greatly
from the collective insights

44
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,790
of your fellow students.

45
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,060
>> So now, let's get ready for
what should be a very interesting ride.

46
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,815
Jump right into the first lesson,
and enjoy the course.

47
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:47,315
