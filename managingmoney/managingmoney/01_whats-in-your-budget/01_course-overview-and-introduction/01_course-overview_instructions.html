  About the Course
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course will introduce college students in a practical way to the world of personal finance as well as time and career management. It will provide students with a useful set of tools from economics and finance that will allow them to move forward into the world upon graduation with a solid foundation in managing their money, time, and career. In a course of this nature, it is unavoidable that some of the content relates solely to the United States. Personal finance touches on topics that are governed by the nation's tax code, financial regulations, consumer protections, and so forth. However, students outside of the United States will still benefit from many of the principles, explanations, and exercises offered by the course.
