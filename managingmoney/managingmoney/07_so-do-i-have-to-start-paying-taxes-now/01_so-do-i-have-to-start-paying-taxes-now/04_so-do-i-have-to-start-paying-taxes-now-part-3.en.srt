1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,410
As a final piece of the income tax puzzle,
I want to start off this part of our

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,150
lesson with a brief discussion
about tax accountants.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,480
At this stage of your life,
things are financially pretty simple, so

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,780
preparing your taxes yourself and
looking for possible deductions is doable.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,520
This is particularly true if you
follow my advice to use some

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,050
tax preparation software to assist you.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,500
That said, as your finances grow and

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,770
become more complex, a tax accountant
may be able to add value to your life.

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,020
One reason is that, the time you
would spend going through a very

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,010
complex tax return might
be better used elsewhere.

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,250
That's the opportunity cost
of doing your own return.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,730
Second, tax laws constantly change,
and tax accountants are likely better

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,810
informed about such changes, and therefore
better able to minimize your tax bill.

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,980
Still, at this stage in your
life I strongly recommend

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,380
a hands-on approach to
filing your income taxes.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,640
Do take this task seriously.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,600
Use a tax prep software
if you can afford it.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,990
And here's another key tip.

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,110
Be sure and file your tax returns early if
it looks like the government is going to

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,660
owe you money back.

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,150
And it's faster if you file by computer,
rather than through the mail.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,730
By filing early,
you'll get that money back sooner,

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,300
rather than later, and
get it working or playing for you.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,837
Now, let's finish up with two other not so

25
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:32,280
random observations
about the tax landscape.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,890
First, about 150 countries, and
all countries in the European Union,

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,710
rely more on a value-added tax, rather
than an income tax for their revenues.

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,750
In fact, the United States is
the only major developed country

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,860
without the so-called VAT tax.

30
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,570
With a value added tax, a tax is imposed
at each stage of production on the way for

31
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,720
something to become a final
product sold at a retail store.

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,539
And in some sense,
it's just a more complicated sales tax.

33
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,120
Proponents of the VAT tax claim it
is more efficient than income taxes,

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,500
because an income tax may discourage
people from both working and investing.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,460
Why?

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,810
Because an income tax does indeed
tax both working and investing.

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,950
A VAT tax on the other hand,
as a consumption tax,

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,590
encourages more savings or
so the argument goes.

39
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,450
I don't want to get any deeper into that
argument, but I thought you should at

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,260
least know about one of the most important
taxes in the world outside US borders.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,880
So final point I want to make about taxes,
you may want to educate yourself

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,540
on the kind of pension program
your government might run for you.

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,580
In the United States, that program
is known as Social Security, and

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,160
everyone who picks up a paycheck
in America contributes annually to

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,670
the Social Security system, and
it's a pretty big bite of your paycheck.

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,150
The important thing to understand
about Social Security is that,

47
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,470
it is not a true pension program.

48
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,770
What I mean by that is this.

49
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,710
In a true pension program,

50
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,100
the money you put into your pension is
put to work in investments for you.

51
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,600
Upon retirement, you can then draw on that
pension based upon what you put in and

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,850
what your investments earn.

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,930
In contrast, the Social Security
system is a pay as you go system.

54
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,840
That is the money you put in is,
basically,

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,730
used to fund the retirement
of people already retired.

56
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,840
To put this another way,
your contribution into Social Security

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,380
is not put to work for you, but
rather used to pay for other people.

58
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,740
I'm telling you this,
because as the American population ages,

59
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,530
there are going to be fewer and
fewer workers like you supporting more and

60
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,620
more retirees like Professor Navarro
when his time comes.

61
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,830
Because of that,

62
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,360
many experts are predicting funding
shortfalls in the Social Security system.

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,255
This problem is hardly unique
to government pension programs.

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,500
Europe and other Asian countries like
Japan are facing similar problems.

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,540
Why am I telling you this?

66
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,220
For one simple reason.

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,910
In planning for your future, you
shouldn't count on completely living off

68
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,890
a government pension like Social Security.

69
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,958
Instead, you should think about saving and
investing yourself, quite possibly

70
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:29,670
in vehicles like individual retirement
accounts that are tax deductible.

71
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,590
And with that observation
this lesson's a wrap.

72
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:42,590
