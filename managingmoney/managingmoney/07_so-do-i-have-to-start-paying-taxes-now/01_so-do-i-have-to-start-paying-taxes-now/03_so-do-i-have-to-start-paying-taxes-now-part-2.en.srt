1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,855
If you're in college, maybe you've
had to file an income tax return for

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,596
a summer job or internship, but

3
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:10,878
the odds are that you haven't really
needed to worry much about income taxes.

4
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:15,397
But as soon as you get that
great job upon graduation and

5
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:18,007
start seeing that big salary roll in,
you and

6
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:21,459
the tax man are going to develop
a very close relationship.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,300
So it's never too early to learn about
how to file your income tax return and

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,200
minimize your tax bill no matter
what country you live in.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,710
So let's start with some basics.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,340
In most systems, your income tax
is determined by four things.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,290
The amount of income you earned,

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,260
any expenses that you may
legally deduct from that income,

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,690
any tax exemptions you are allowed and
the tax rate you will be charged.

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,900
In terms of the basic math, it comes down
to your income minus any deductions and

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,200
exemptions.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,480
That's your so-called Taxable Income.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,810
This taxable income is then
multiplied by your marginal tax rate

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,440
to determine your taxes owed.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,740
Now let's break this down a bit.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,920
Your marginal tax rate will be the same
if your country uses a flat or

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,790
proportional tax.

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,000
However in countries with
a progressive tax system,

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,780
your marginal tax rate will rise with
the amount of your taxable income.

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,000
As for any tax exemptions,

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,680
if you have any children you
can claim them as a dependent.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,500
Just like your parents have been claiming
you as an exemption for most of your life.

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,290
And there are other exemptions
as well depending on the system.

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,680
Now let's get to the two biggest elements
your income and your other deductions.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,860
The amount of income you report is
your gross income or total income.

30
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,740
It's a collection of income
from all the possible sources.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,640
Two of the most common sources here are
the wages you earned and the dividends and

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,939
interest you may have received
from holding stocks and bonds.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,900
In addition, there are capital gains
associated with selling stocks or property

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,450
for a profit, and maybe even the rental
income you received on a property you own.

35
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,400
Now, from that gross income,

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
you are allowed to deduct any legitimate
expenses specified by the tax authority.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,780
And this is where you really
want to become an expert.

38
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,130
For example, one of the biggest
deductions in the American tax system

39
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,550
is the deduction for
any interest paid on your mortgage.

40
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,330
In fact, this is a huge incentive for
you to own your own home.

41
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,020
Because the government is effectively
helping you to pay for it by giving you

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,040
a tax break, and it's hardly the only
deduction associated with homeownership.

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,290
Other deductions associated with
homeownership include causality loss,

44
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,740
if your home is damaged or destroyed.

45
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,030
Energy credits.

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,610
Real estate taxes.

47
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,500
And even first-time homebuyer credits.

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,630
More broadly, there are deductions for
charity, moving expenses, and so on.

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,360
And if you work for yourself,
you'll be able to deduct

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,050
a whole range of expenses associated
with running your business.

51
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,270
The broader point here is this,
wherever you may live,

52
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,580
you need to get to know your
tax system and its deductions.

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,980
And here's a key tip, while your income
tax form is likely to be pretty simple and

54
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,310
won't likely require any
sophisticated software,

55
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,470
I still recommend that you consider
buying your own tax preparation software.

56
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,370
On this note, in the United States,
the Internal Revenue Service has a program

57
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:41,740
called free file at irs.gov/freefile
where they offer software and

58
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,770
tools to help you file your taxes
if your income is under $58,000.

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,010
For most of us in the near
term that will be the ticket.

60
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,080
That said, a commercial tax prep software
is likely to be more informative.

61
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
Such software will not only
guide you through the process

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,910
it will also provide you with the full
laundry list of possible deductions.

63
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,440
While you may not be eligible for these
deductions at this point in your life,

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,370
you will at least learn about them, and
thereby, learn how you might incorporate

65
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,150
such deductions into your future
financial decisions and plans.

66
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,030
Some important tools here include
investments, retirement accounts, and

67
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,860
accounts to put away savings for
your children's education.

68
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,350
In fact, my parents are paying for
college with such an account and

69
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,190
they save thousands of dollars
in taxes by planning ahead.

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,010
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

71
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,326
At any rate, let's move on to final issues
and key tips in part three of this lesson.

72
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:49,549
