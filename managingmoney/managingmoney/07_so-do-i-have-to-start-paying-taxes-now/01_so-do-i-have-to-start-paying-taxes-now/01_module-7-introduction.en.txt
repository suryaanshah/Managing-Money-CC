[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Prof Navarro. >> And I'm Alex LeBon. >> All right. So what's up for today's lesson? >> It's tax time, all manner of taxes. >> All right.
How many can you name off the top of your head. >> Let's see.
We have income, property, gas, state, value added, payroll, unemployment. >> Hm?
You really have to pay a tax when you're unemployed? >> Not quite. That's a tax people with jobs have to pay,
so there's money around for the government to help
people without a job. Including you, if you have bad luck. >> Sounds like socialism to me. >> Or maybe just good economic policy. >> That's the funny thing about taxes. People in the political arena
argue about them all the time. >> Well, perhaps with good reason. After all, in some countries over half of your income
goes to paying your taxes every year. So are we going to get into
a debate today about taxation? >> No,
I'm just going to explain how taxes work, talk about some of the arguments
justifying taxation, then show our students some cool tips about how to
manage their tax bill every year. >> All right, sounds like a plan, but before we get started,
let's play a little game of who said what. >> Okay, go for it. >> All right, first one. No taxation without representation. >> That's the anti King George slogan
that got the American revolution going. >> Hm, nice. How about this one. If you get up early, you work late,
and pay your taxes, you will be rich. If you strike oil. >> [LAUGH] That sounds like oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. >> You're on a roll.
How about this one. The income tax created more criminals
than any other single act of government. >> That would be American senator and
arch conservative Barry Goldwater. >> Okay, Mr. physics major. Sure you're gonna get this one. The hardest thing in the world
to understand is the income tax. >> Nice clue. That person? Albert Einstein. He could figure out relativity, but taxes? Maybe too tough. >> Indeed.
Okay, here's the last one. Only two things that are certain
in life are death and taxes. >> Well, you'll have to go to the first
lesson if you want that answer. >> All right,
off you go when you're ready. [MUSIC]
