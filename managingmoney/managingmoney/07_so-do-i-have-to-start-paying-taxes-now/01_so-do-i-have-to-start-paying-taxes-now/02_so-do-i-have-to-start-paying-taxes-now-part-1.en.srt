1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,650
Okay so,
I know you're dying to know who said

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,800
the only two things in life that
are certain are death and taxes.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,980
Well, it was none other than one
of Americas founding fathers,

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,350
Benjamin Franklin.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,409
And he might have added that, even when
you die you are likely to get taxed,

6
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:19,534
at least in some countries that
have the so-called estate tax.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,260
As for why taxes are so certain in your
life, the big reason is that every

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,400
government in the world needs tax revenue
to fund the various services it provides.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,190
Everything from a military and
a justice system to roads,

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,960
bridges and air traffic control.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,220
While few people really argue about the
need for at least some level of government

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,300
expenditure, therefore at least some
level of taxation, there's considerable

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,890
debate over how much tax revenue should
be raised and how taxes should be levied.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,310
There is also the perennial
question of who in any society

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,560
should bear the greatest or
smallest burden of any tax.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,080
And whether the tax system
should be used like Robin Hood,

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,890
to redistribute income
from the rich to the poor.

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,230
We're not really going to get into the
politics of all this, but here's a quick

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,260
overview with at least some of
the issues from an economic perspective.

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,210
For starters, there are considerable
differences between the types of taxes

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,510
out there and their link to actual need.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,160
For example, gasoline use taxes are used,
at least ostensibly, to raise

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,870
money to build roads and freeways for
the vehicles that use that infrastructure.

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,280
So that kind of tax is levied under
the so-called benefit principle,

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,570
you get what you're taxed for.

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,480
Second major type of use
tax is the sales tax.

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,530
The big beef with sales taxes politically
is that they are regressive in nature.

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,470
That is, a larger fraction of
their burden falls on the poor.

29
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,380
And that's why in some states or
countries, necessities like groceries and

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,089
prescription drugs
are exempt from sales tax.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,000
In contrast,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,320
the income tax in many nations around
the world is generally a progressive tax.

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,900
With a progressive tax,
as your income rises,

34
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,630
the percentage you are taxed
on that income rises as well.

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,580
And in contrast to the benefit principle,

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,920
the principle underlying progressive
taxes is that of ability to pay.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,950
Think Robin Hood here, where the rich are
taxed at a higher rate to help the poor.

38
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,440
And yes, that's a principle that is
the focus of considerable debate.

39
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,250
Now, in addition to these kinds of taxes,
there is one of the most important taxes

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,950
local governments use,
the property tax on homeowners.

41
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,995
At least in theory, property taxes
are supposed to be used to pay for

42
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:50,455
the infrastructure and services needed
in local communities like sewer and

43
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:56,805
water lines, roads and stop signs,
schools and, yes, even jails.

44
00:02:56,805 --> 00:03:00,751
On top of this, there are all sorts or
license costs and fees out there.

45
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:04,945
For example, people often have to pay for
a license to hunt.

46
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:08,250
And the rationale there is not just
to pay for the game wardens and

47
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,230
other related services, but
also to limit the number of hunters and

48
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,350
thereby perhaps conserve the fish or
deer or other types of game.

49
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,590
Finally, there are so-called sin taxes
on stuff like cigarettes and alcohol.

50
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,330
Well, the idea of such sin taxes may
be to discourage smoking or drinking.

51
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,981
They are also great sources
of revenue because demand for

52
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:34,260
so-called sinful products
is highly inelastic.

53
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,080
Meaning that smokers and drinkers aren't
all that responsive to changes in price.

54
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,970
Needless to say, there is a great deal of
debate among populaces around the world

55
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,340
about the level and
burden of the taxes levied.

56
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,160
And we are not going to
settle that debate here.

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,890
One of the most important things I can
help you with however, and a key theme of

58
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,340
this lesson, is to learn how to minimize
your tax bill without breaking the law.

59
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,830
In fact, there are a lot of small ways to
structure your finances and investments

60
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,800
that will let you walk away with
a smaller bill and bite from the tax man.

61
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,880
This practice is known as tax mitigation,
or tax avoidance.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,510
And it is a very different animal
that what's called tax evasion.

63
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,050
With tax evasion, you blatantly cheat
on your taxes to not pay as much.

64
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,680
You might do this by
falsifying documents or

65
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,310
hiding income or
not filing a tax return at all.

66
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,870
But now hear this.

67
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,550
Tax evasion is a losing game,
and if you don't believe me,

68
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,640
just ask one of the worst criminals
in American history, Al Capone.

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,290
Of all the crimes Scarface ever committed,
the only one he was every convicted for

70
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,340
was tax evasion.

71
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,040
And joining him in the slammer
at different points in time

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,500
have been other famous celebs ranging
from Martha Stewart and Wesley Snipes,

73
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,720
to Leona Helmsley to even baseball player,
Pete Rose.

74
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,870
My message?

75
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,090
Don't mess with the tax man.

76
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,760
That said, you can mess quite
a bit with tax mitigation.

77
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,990
This includes strategies like choosing
investments with a lower tax burden,

78
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,260
looking for deductions that you can make,
and putting money in accounts that carry

79
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:23,200
a lower tax liability, like
an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA.

80
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,090
And even some taxes, like the property tax
are tax deductible on your income taxes,

81
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,200
which is just one more reason why
it may be better to own than rent.

82
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,650
Of course,
these are all pretty high level things.

83
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,738
So let's not get carried
away with the details.

84
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:42,800
The main take-away here is that
you can plan your finances and

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,309
do your taxes in such a way
that will save you money.

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,425
So now on to part two of this
lesson when you are ready,

87
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:53,029
where we will focus on the income tax and
what you need to know.

88
00:05:53,029 --> 00:06:00,789
