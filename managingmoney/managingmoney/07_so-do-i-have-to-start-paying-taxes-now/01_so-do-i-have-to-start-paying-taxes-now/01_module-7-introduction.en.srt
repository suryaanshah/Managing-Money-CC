2
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:09,228
Hi, I'm Prof Navarro.

3
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:10,424
>> And I'm Alex LeBon.

4
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:11,049
>> All right.

5
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:11,582
So what's up for today's lesson?

6
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:15,803
>> It's tax time, all manner of taxes.

7
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:17,373
>> All right.
How many can you name off the top of

8
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:18,860
your head.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,510
>> Let's see.
We have income, property, gas,

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,820
state, value added, payroll, unemployment.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,540
>> Hm?
You really have to pay a tax when

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,150
you're unemployed?

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,410
>> Not quite.

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,890
That's a tax people with jobs have to pay,
so there's money around for

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,520
the government to help
people without a job.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,950
Including you, if you have bad luck.

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,370
>> Sounds like socialism to me.

18
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,910
>> Or maybe just good economic policy.

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,610
>> That's the funny thing about taxes.

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,740
People in the political arena
argue about them all the time.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,440
>> Well, perhaps with good reason.

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,030
After all,

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,400
in some countries over half of your income
goes to paying your taxes every year.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,770
So are we going to get into
a debate today about taxation?

25
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,890
>> No,
I'm just going to explain how taxes work,

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,860
talk about some of the arguments
justifying taxation, then show our

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,890
students some cool tips about how to
manage their tax bill every year.

28
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,170
>> All right, sounds like a plan,

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,820
but before we get started,
let's play a little game of who said what.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,170
>> Okay, go for it.

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,000
>> All right, first one.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,480
No taxation without representation.

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,380
>> That's the anti King George slogan
that got the American revolution going.

34
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,080
>> Hm, nice.

35
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,790
How about this one.

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,150
If you get up early, you work late,
and pay your taxes, you will be rich.

37
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,025
If you strike oil.

38
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:41,850
>> [LAUGH] That sounds like oil tycoon J.

39
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,030
Paul Getty.

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,550
>> You're on a roll.
How about this one.

41
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,590
The income tax created more criminals
than any other single act of government.

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,640
>> That would be American senator and
arch conservative Barry Goldwater.

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,940
>> Okay, Mr. physics major.

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,640
Sure you're gonna get this one.

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,980
The hardest thing in the world
to understand is the income tax.

46
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,010
>> Nice clue.

47
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,980
That person?

48
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,620
Albert Einstein.

49
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,160
He could figure out relativity, but taxes?

50
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,380
Maybe too tough.

51
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,090
>> Indeed.
Okay, here's the last one.

52
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,110
Only two things that are certain
in life are death and taxes.

53
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,092
>> Well, you'll have to go to the first
lesson if you want that answer.

54
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:19,261
>> All right,
off you go when you're ready.

55
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:26,979
