2
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:09,479
Hi I'm Prof Navarro.

3
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,126
>> And I'm Alex LeBon.

4
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:14,740
>> So Mister Alex, what are we
gonna do here in our final lesson?

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,740
It better be epic.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,040
>> Well I'm not sure I
can deliver on that.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,440
But I am going to take you on
a roller coaster ride through what

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,590
the best MBAs know.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,190
>> The best MBAs know.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,970
That sounds pretty ambitious.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,760
>> True.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,440
But whether you are going to go
into business for yourself or

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,460
simply need some skills for your own
personal financial needs, I can't think

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,008
of a better way of obtaining those skills
than by stealing from the MBA playbook.

15
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:48,900
>> All right Mr. Sticky Fingers,
so are we ready to start?

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,960
>> Not quite.
I want to challenge you to a quotation

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,570
contest.

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,510
>> All right, what are the rules?

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,660
We'll take turns naming a functional
area of the MBA curriculum, and

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,960
the other person has to
come up with a cool quote.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,710
>> Hm.
Sounds like fun.

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,180
You go first.

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,784
>> Right.

24
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:08,176
Here's an easy one.

25
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:08,830
Marketing.
>> Marketing.

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,140
All right, how about this?

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,860
People don't buy quarter-inch drills,
they buy quarter-inch holes.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,570
>> Not bad.
How about one more from marketing?

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,980
>> All right, hm.

30
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,680
All right, here we go.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,443
In the factory we make cosmetics,
at the drugstore we sell hope.

32
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:34,219
>> Nice.

33
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,403
>> Now, your turn.

34
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:37,597
Here's your category.

35
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,642
Statistics.

36
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:42,230
>> Here's my favorite.

37
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,090
You can't manage what you can't measure.

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,590
>> Hm.
That's pretty good.

39
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,110
Got another one from statistics?

40
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,470
>> Heck no, statisticians are boring.

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
And on the subject of boring,
how about a quotation from accounting?

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,820
All right.

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,190
How about this,

44
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,170
the earlier you get the information,
the easier it is to fix the problem.

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,860
>> Well done,
since I'm not likely to stump you,

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,915
how about we get on with this lesson?

47
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:11,749
>> [LAUGH] Okay, ready when you are.

48
