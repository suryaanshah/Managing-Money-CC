1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,070
In this part of the lesson I want to show
you how each of the five parts of our

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,280
MBA conceptual framework fit into
the actual management of a business.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,040
And I wanna do this by literally taking
you from the ground up to the catbird seat

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,910
of one of the top corporations in
the world hypothetically of course.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,730
Suppose then you are a young Bill Gates
with a hot piece of software.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,000
Or, better yet, a young Steve Jobs
with an even hotter piece of software.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,460
By using this software or
hardware, you and

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,260
your schoolmates have come up with what
you believe is the next killer application

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,300
in the world of high technology.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,330
And this killer app,
which you have already patented is so

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:49,880
astonishing that you, well you fill in
the blank here because I've got no idea.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,470
>> At any rate, if you are going
to develop this product properly,

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,560
the first step you will want to
take is to create a business plan.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,442
As we learn from Professor Archy,
such a plan will precisely define your

15
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:09,724
business and identify goals and include
such financial accounting tools such

16
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:14,942
as a pro-forma balance sheet,
income statement, and cash flow analysis.

17
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:22,546
This plan will also describe what service
or product your business will reach and

18
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:27,336
what needs in the marketplace it will
fill, as well as who your potential

19
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:33,190
customers are, how you will reach them and
why they will purchase it from you.

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,680
Armed with such a business plan, you and
your partners can go about the business

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,640
of trying to raise enough venture capital
to get the project up and running.

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,280
Now if your company is successful,
you will constantly be raising additional

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,220
funds to build new facilities,
modernize old ones and

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,570
maybe even acquire some of your rivals to
consolidate your position in the industry.

25
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,470
All of this will take money and
it will be your corporate finance team

26
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,180
that will help you determine whether you
will finance growth by issuing stock or

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,990
bonds or drawing on retained earnings.

28
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,180
Or, most realistically,
using some optimal combination

29
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,250
of all three of these forms of so
called capital financing.

30
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,350
Assuming all goes well with this
fundraising phase of the business, and

31
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,660
that you have enough capital to
get your venture off the ground,

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,460
here are just some of the questions
you will be asking your other teams of

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,210
MBA equipped experts that you necessarily
will assemble to help your company.

34
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,600
For starters, even if your product seems
like a sure winner, you may still want

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,510
your management strategy team to
examine questions such as these.

36
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,530
Should you even enter the market?

37
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,110
And, is there room for another competitor?

38
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,160
Perhaps not.

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,920
Are there rivals out there who could
bury you with deep financial pockets,

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,760
reputational capital, and established
marketing and distribution chains?

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,800
Perhaps so.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,700
If you get the green light from your
strategy team and enter the market

43
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,090
you will also want to know which part
of the market you want to attack.

44
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,000
For example, the high end,
high quality high margin end

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,240
versus the low end,
lower quality, tight margin end.

46
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,030
In consultation with your
operations management team,

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,860
managerial economists, and your
marketing team, your strategy team will

48
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,430
also want to consider whether the company
should actually produce the product or

49
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,930
outsource production and
simply distribute.

50
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,940
And if your company is going
to produce the product,

51
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,550
just where should
the facilities be located?

52
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,370
Should you produce it locally or
perhaps in a state like Tennessee or

53
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,700
Texas with a more business
friendly climate?

54
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,330
Or should you seek an international
location like India, Indonesia or

55
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,120
Malaysia where wages are cheap but
political upheaval is more of a risk.

56
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,030
Let's next suppose that, after reviewing
all of the information, you do in

57
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,215
fact decide that you will produce your
own product locally at this point,

58
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:10,175
you'll want to discuss with
your operations management team

59
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:14,375
how to design a production
process that is most efficient.

60
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,785
This, of course, will entail
a detailed examination of your so

61
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,485
called supply chain.

62
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:23,015
The chain of various
inputs such as energy and

63
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:26,195
raw materials in your production process.

64
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:32,460
Now, once you have produced your product,
the next step will be to sell it.

65
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,610
This will be the responsibility
of your marketing team.

66
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,100
It will be the role of this team to

67
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,750
figure out the most appropriate
distribution channels.

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,350
Should you sell wholesale to big chains
like Walmart or Costco, or open your

69
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,560
own line of retail stores or just sell the
product Amazon style over the Internet?

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,720
Your marketing and sales team must also
figure out an advertising strategy, and

71
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,610
the most appropriate message around
which to build this strategy.

72
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,480
Of course with considerable input from
your firm's managerial economists

73
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,650
the marketing and sales team will
also determine a pricing structure.

74
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,740
Now I am personally convinced that your
product will be wildly successful and

75
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,170
the money will start pouring in.

76
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,180
As it does so,
it will be the job of the financial and

77
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,440
managerial accounting teams to carefully
track both cost and revenue flows.

78
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,200
Essentially, this team
will be your scorekeepers.

79
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,530
It will be able to tell you
whether you are making it or

80
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,190
whether your firm will soon go belly up.

81
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,400
This team will account for
the various cost and revenue streams,

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,900
calculate your profits, earnings to
shareholders, and pay your taxes.

83
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,830
And importantly, internally use such
information to improve decision making.

84
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,310
And how is organization behavior and
leadership critical to our story?

85
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,920
Well in the early stages of the company,
you and

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,300
your entrepreneurial partners will likely
know all or most of the employees.

87
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,490
And you together will make
most of the decisions.

88
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,330
And like a lot of entrepreneurs you may
manage your company mostly from your gut

89
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,389
rather than in a manner taught
in the management textbooks.

90
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,880
Note, however, that as your company grows
and prospers, you will likely notice

91
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,960
that not only does it become increasingly
difficult to keep track of everyone, but

92
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,930
also that any flaws in your personal
management style will be amplified.

93
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,070
Accordingly, once your fledgling
company reaches a certain critical mass

94
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,490
It will become absolutely
essential that you pay more and

95
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,360
more attention to how your
company is actually organized.

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,280
And what incentive structures you have in
place to make sure it operates efficiently

97
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,870
and to its full potential.

98
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,370
At such a point,
you will come to rely more and

99
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,840
more on your organizational behavior.

100
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,360
And your human resources management teams
to appropriately staff the corporation.

101
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,790
Have procedures in place to
ensure best management practices.

102
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:13,310
And perhaps most importantly of all
create a management culture where morale

103
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,700
is always high, productivity is
maximized and efficiency rules.

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,180
At this stage in your corporation's
development, it will become

105
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,300
equally important that you become more and
more aware of the political and

106
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,140
regulatory environment within
which a firm operates.

107
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,730
This is where your business and
government teams with strut their stuff.

108
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,850
Want to locate a new plant
in a particular state?

109
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,960
You may have to lobby the local city
council or state legislature for

110
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,150
the appropriate permits.

111
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,870
Make your money primarily
from the Internet?

112
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,300
Some states, and even the federal
government, may be trying to

113
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,780
impose new taxes on the Internet that
your industry may want to fight.

114
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,920
Want a bigger capital investment tax
credit that will allow you to build

115
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,840
a new plant locally, and
there by help keep jobs in the country?

116
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,500
That might be a nice argument that
your corporate lobbying team can

117
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,150
pitch to a congressman or key committee.

118
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,730
Of course, throughout this whole process
in which your company grows from a small

119
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,615
seed in your consciousness to a large cap
stock on the New York Stock Exchange,

120
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:27,065
you and all your employees will want to
conduct yourselves in a manner consistent

121
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:29,665
with both the law and
certain ethical cannons.

122
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:36,242
However, during this ongoing process
of wooing consumers on the one hand and

123
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,372
fighting competitors on the other.

124
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:43,232
You will soon learn that, at least in
some cases, the law will allow you to do

125
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:47,960
things that may not In fact,
be up to your own ethical standards.

126
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,840
Or you may even be tempted
to cross an ethical or

127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,900
legal line to ensure your firm's success.

128
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,300
In such cases,
will you serve your shareholders?

129
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,650
Or your own moral conscious?

130
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,240
And how,
buffeted by these ethical crosswinds,

131
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,960
will you determine the right thing to do?

132
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,430
Hopefully with the help
of both your lawyers and

133
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,430
other advisors you will figure that out.

134
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,660
And a solid grounding in the concepts and

135
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,210
lessons of corporate
ethics will surely help.

136
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,030
At any rate, you can see from this
example how all the various pieces of

137
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,140
the MBA core curriculum fit together
to make a profitable enterprise.

138
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,430
Well you may never be that entrepreneur
who starts the whole project to

139
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,090
begin with, this overview will at least
give you an idea of how things work.

140
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,560
From a career standpoint, one of the worst
things you can do in this world is be

141
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,670
content to be a cog in the machine, and
never know how the machine actually works.

142
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,264
But here's my last key tip.

143
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:53,631
When you're on the job market,
if you have a better understanding of how

144
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:58,355
enterprises work, no matter what part of
that enterprise you may wind up in you

145
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:01,434
are likely to do much better
in your job interview,

146
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:06,610
if you present yourself as someone with a
big picture perspective of the enterprise.

147
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,172
All right, that's it for
part two, when you're ready,

148
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:13,017
move on to part three and
our closing remarks.

149
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:19,557
