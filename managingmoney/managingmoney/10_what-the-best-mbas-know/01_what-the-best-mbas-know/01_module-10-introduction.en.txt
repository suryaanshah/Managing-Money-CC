[MUSIC] Hi I'm Prof Navarro. >> And I'm Alex LeBon. >> So Mister Alex, what are we
gonna do here in our final lesson? It better be epic. >> Well I'm not sure I
can deliver on that. But I am going to take you on
a roller coaster ride through what the best MBAs know. >> The best MBAs know. That sounds pretty ambitious. >> True. But whether you are going to go
into business for yourself or simply need some skills for your own
personal financial needs, I can't think of a better way of obtaining those skills
than by stealing from the MBA playbook. >> All right Mr. Sticky Fingers,
so are we ready to start? >> Not quite.
I want to challenge you to a quotation contest. >> All right, what are the rules? We'll take turns naming a functional
area of the MBA curriculum, and the other person has to
come up with a cool quote. >> Hm.
Sounds like fun. You go first. >> Right. Here's an easy one. Marketing.
>> Marketing. All right, how about this? People don't buy quarter-inch drills,
they buy quarter-inch holes. >> Not bad.
How about one more from marketing? >> All right, hm. All right, here we go. In the factory we make cosmetics,
at the drugstore we sell hope. >> Nice. >> Now, your turn. Here's your category. Statistics. >> Here's my favorite. You can't manage what you can't measure. >> Hm.
That's pretty good. Got another one from statistics? >> Heck no, statisticians are boring. And on the subject of boring,
how about a quotation from accounting? All right. How about this, the earlier you get the information,
the easier it is to fix the problem. >> Well done,
since I'm not likely to stump you, how about we get on with this lesson? >> [LAUGH] Okay, ready when you are. [MUSIC]
