1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,630
Well, we hope you have enjoyed this course
in managing your time, money, and career.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,880
>> And I've had a great time sharing
with you some of the great lessons from

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,130
the world of business.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,640
>> As you move forward in life,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,750
we hope you will take many of
the lessons from this course with you.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,050
>> And
hopefully use those lessons to create for

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,499
yourself a more prosperous and
rewarding life.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,460
>> Now here's the final piece
of advice I can offer you, and

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,990
it's one I offer to all
of my MBA students.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,800
Be sure to cultivate the habit of
reading the financial press every day,

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,710
in some form or another.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,140
You can do that by reading
newspapers like the Financial Times,

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,980
or The Wall Street Journal,
either online or in the print edition.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,430
>> Or you can do it like I do,
using a news aggregator that brings

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,230
to me 24/7 the breaking financial and
economic news of the day.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,330
>> Doesn't matter what your career will be
in life, you will need the skills we've

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,460
shared with you in this course to manage
at least some part of your affairs.

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,780
So as Spock once said,
live well and prosper.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,248
>> I hope Professor Navarro and
I have helped you in some small way.

20
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:06,607
We'll see you down the road.

21
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:16,607
