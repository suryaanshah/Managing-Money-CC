Well, we hope you have enjoyed this course
in managing your time, money, and career. >> And I've had a great time sharing
with you some of the great lessons from the world of business. >> As you move forward in life, we hope you will take many of
the lessons from this course with you. >> And
hopefully use those lessons to create for yourself a more prosperous and
rewarding life. >> Now here's the final piece
of advice I can offer you, and it's one I offer to all
of my MBA students. Be sure to cultivate the habit of
reading the financial press every day, in some form or another. You can do that by reading
newspapers like the Financial Times, or The Wall Street Journal,
either online or in the print edition. >> Or you can do it like I do,
using a news aggregator that brings to me 24/7 the breaking financial and
economic news of the day. >> Doesn't matter what your career will be
in life, you will need the skills we've shared with you in this course to manage
at least some part of your affairs. So as Spock once said,
live well and prosper. >> I hope Professor Navarro and
I have helped you in some small way. We'll see you down the road. [MUSIC]
