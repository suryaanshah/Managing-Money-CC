1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,940
Each year from the ivy covered
halls of Harvard and Wharton.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,510
And the sun drenched campuses
of Stanford and USC.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,824
To the intellectual vineyards of France's
ENSEA, the fabled London School of

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,630
Business, and the teaming campus of Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,678
More 100,000 students
graduate from full or

6
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:28,260
part time regular and
executive MBA programs.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,170
That's three times the number of law
degrees, more than four times the number

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,100
of engineering degrees, and more than
seven times the number of medical degrees.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,050
Now, I know that a business degree
may not be in your future at all.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,060
You may aspire to be a scientist,
an artist,

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,450
or even a lawyer,
despite the surplus of lawyer jokes.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,490
But whatever is in your future,
there are some important lessons

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,180
that you can learn from the things
that are taught in business schools.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,410
One of the first things is this.

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,434
At any given business school you will
of course learn the key concepts,

16
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:10,800
tools, and skills that
are the foundation of the MBA degree.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,560
Really, the more important thing
to gain from business school for

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,980
many students, is the invaluable
set of networks that you can

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,880
develop as part of your MBA experience.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,966
But only if you are open
during that experience and

21
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,990
aware of just how important
those networks are.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,040
So before we tackle the idea
of what's in an MBA toolbox,

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,990
I would like you to think about
your own undergraduate experience.

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,520
Are you the kind of student that
spends all your time studying and

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,760
little time interacting with your
classmates and other students?

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,280
That may well be a good strategy if
your goal is to get great grades and

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,180
get into graduate school.

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,710
However, do keep in mind that all those
other students that you are sharing your

29
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,360
experience with are fellow
travelers in the world.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,770
And they might be helpful to
you some time in the future.

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,895
So that's the first key tip,

32
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,855
don't forget to cultivate your
networks when you're a student

33
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:14,525
because they can be as valuable as
anything you might learn in the classroom.

34
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:19,055
Okay, with that bit of pontificating,
let's start our journey into what the best

35
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,945
MBA's know with an overview
of the MBA curriculum.

36
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:28,929
Let's start with one of the most important
MBA tools, the conceptual framework.

37
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,600
Here, conceptually,
we can think about the MBA degree

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,300
as being divided into five main
interrelated and interlocking parts.

39
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,580
The first part is the MBA toolbox.

40
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:46,155
This is the world of
quantitative analysis and

41
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:51,595
it includes tools like statistics,
decision analysis, and modeling.

42
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:54,915
This is an area that drills right
down to that quotation that I shared

43
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:56,110
with you earlier.

44
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,270
Namely that you can't manage
what you can't measure.

45
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,340
Some of the big questions of
managerial analysis include things like

46
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,470
how to evaluate risk and
how to model decision making.

47
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,170
Of course,
the biggest question of all may be,

48
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,570
how you should interpret
data in decision making.

49
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,210
The big personal takeaway here is,
don't rely just on your gut and

50
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,500
intuition to make your decisions.

51
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,450
Know how to use the available
data to help yourself.

52
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,100
As for the second part of the MBA
curriculum, this is the functional MBA.

53
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,972
Basically, when you look at
corporations and businesses,

54
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:40,220
they are typically divided into functional
areas like operations management,

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,480
marketing, financial and
cost accounting and corporate finance.

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,810
In fact, this is the bread and
butter of the traditional MBA curriculum.

57
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,240
By studying these topics, you'll learn
how to find and manage the funds for

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,770
your company's capital facilities and
activities.

59
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,770
You will also learn how to produce,
distribute, market and

60
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,830
sell your products and services.

61
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,920
As I talk about each of these areas in
parts two and three of this lesson,

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,860
this should be a good time to see if any
of these areas have any appeal to you.

63
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,640
It's never to soon to start
thinking about your career path.

64
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,990
Do you like the order, logic,
and discipline of accounting?

65
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,750
Are you an extrovert who loves
selling ideas and products?

66
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,860
Or are you a puzzle master
who loves designing

67
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,720
intricate systems to make things work?

68
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,410
As for
the third part of the MBA core curriculum,

69
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,660
it is what I call
the Strategic & Tactical MBA.

70
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,770
Basically you have two main courses here,
strategy and macroeconomics.

71
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,110
Strategy is a cool course
that teaches you both how and

72
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,240
why to make the big decisions
every corporation faces.

73
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,860
From market entry and market
positioning to product diversification,

74
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,510
and mergers and acquisitions.

75
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,470
While it might seem strange to put
macroeconomics in the group with strategy,

76
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,410
the two actually work very well together.

77
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,520
This is because macroeconomics
is all about the when or

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,110
the timing of many strategic decisions.

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,970
From product production and

80
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,640
inventory levels,
to the tone of the marketing messages.

81
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,690
Again, from a career point of view, does
it float your boat to think strategically?

82
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,430
Even if it doesn't, just remember
there's lots of folks out there

83
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,630
you will compete with in the job market,
and

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,820
it may be a good idea to
cultivate a strategic perspective.

85
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,210
Now, the fourth part of the MBA curriculum
is The Organizational & Leadership MBA.

86
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,410
This is the realm of so
called soft skills,

87
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,600
as opposed to the hard skills of data
crunching and supply chain management.

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,570
In studying a topic like organizational
behavior leadership, you will learn just

89
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,160
why and how managing a successful
business is very much a team sport.

90
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,790
You will also see why the best
strategies that a company may pursue,

91
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,450
will ultimately crash and burn if
the company has severe people issues.

92
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,240
This may be a good time to reflect
about your own soft skills.

93
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,190
Are you comfortable talking to small or
large groups?

94
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,890
Do you consider yourself a leader or
a follower?

95
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,950
Are you willing to try to overcome any
shyness in reaching out to people?

96
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,260
If you are the leader,
do you lead by example?

97
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,186
These are all important
questions to consider, and

98
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:43,520
you don't have to wait to go to business
school to start thinking about them.

99
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,525
As for the fifth and
final part of the MBA curriculum,

100
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,640
it's the political and regulatory MBA.

101
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,212
And the courses in this box
have names like, government and

102
00:06:55,212 --> 00:07:00,640
business, ethics and
responsibility, or business law.

103
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,300
And, each in their own way, have to do
with effectively managing an enterprise

104
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,550
within the broader regulatory environment
in which all commerce takes place.

105
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,340
The big take away here, is that knowing
how to jump through regulatory hoops or

106
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,160
navigate a government bureaucracy,
can be every bit as important as

107
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,270
properly pricing a product or having
the right amount of inventory on hand.

108
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,670
So even if you hate big government,
at least learn to know thy enemy.

109
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,800
It's never too soon to start thinking
about the ethical dimensions of what you

110
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,390
do in both your personal and
professional life.

111
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:44,130
As the saying goes, a persons'
character determines his or her fate.

112
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,210
Okay, that's our conceptual framework
to think about what the best MBAs know.

113
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,324
In part two of this lesson,
which should be a lot of fun I might add,

114
00:07:56,324 --> 00:08:01,324
I'm going to show you how each of these
five conceptual areas might come into play

115
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:06,100
if you follow the tips and wisdom of
Professor from the last lesson and

116
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,340
decide to start your own business.

117
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,880
So when you're ready,
let's move on to Part 2.

118
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:18,559
