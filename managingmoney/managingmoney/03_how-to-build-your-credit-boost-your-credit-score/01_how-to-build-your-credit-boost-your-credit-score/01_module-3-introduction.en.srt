00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:09,065
HI, I'm Prof Navarro.

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:10,783
>> And I'm Alex LeBon.

4
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:13,360
>> So Mr. Alex,
what's our topic for today?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,075
>> Well, this is the to our
lecture on credit and debit cards.

6
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:20,941
And we're going to dive deep into the
important task of building your credit and

7
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,392
boosting your credit score.

8
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:24,784
>> So what's the big takeaway?

9
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:26,252
>> Well, for starters,

10
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:30,589
don't fall into the minimum balance
trap with your credit cards.

11
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:34,977
Pay your balances off as quickly
as possible, or ruin your credit.

12
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:36,742
>> Easy for you to say.

13
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:40,851
>> And easy for you to do if you
pay close attention to your budget.

14
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:42,709
>> Okay, tough guy what else?

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,867
>> Well, in a similar vain,
don't pay your bills late.

16
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:50,388
And whatever you do, don't let them wind
up with a collection agency, otherwise,

17
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,182
you'll ruin your credit score.

18
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:55,224
>> [LAUGH] Aren't you
the cold-hearted economist?

19
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,708
Sometimes people do
have a run of bad luck.

20
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,588
They just can't pay their bills.

21
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:03,838
>> Well, of course, but
I'm not talking about that.

22
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:07,789
I'm talking about having your funds in
your account, and letting your bills sit

23
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:10,711
on your desk, because you don't
take the time to pay them.

24
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,730
All I'm saying is it has
a heavy cost down the road.

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,380
>> Fair enough.

26
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,889
What else you got?

27
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,143
>> Well, a bunch.

28
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,188
This is a cool lesson.

29
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:22,692
I'll show you how your credit score these
days can even affect your job prospects.

30
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:23,412
>> Roger that.

31
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:24,550
So let's get on with it.
