1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,270
In this part of the lesson, we're going to
drill down into both credit reports and

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,150
credit scores, and I'll show you
in particular how credit scores

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,060
are actually derived from credit reports.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,450
So let's start off with the credit report.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,480
Your credit report is a detailed
record of your credit history.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,800
And it specifically focuses on your
ability to repay any money you may borrow.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,420
So what you may ask is
in your credit report?

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,450
Well first, it includes personal data
like your current and previous addresses.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,820
Your social security or
national identification number.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,090
And your employment history.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,500
Second, your credit report includes your
credit history and particularly seeks to

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,480
identify the number and type of accounts
you have past due versus in good standing.

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,500
Third, your latest credit report will
document past credit inquiries into your

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,530
credit report.

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,140
So, what's that all about?

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,370
Well it's done as a means of gauging
both your borrowing activity, and

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,770
your possible solvency.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,310
The big statistic here is that,
at least according to one credible source,

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,070
people who have added six or
more inquiries into their reports during

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,140
the past year, can be up to eight
times more likely to file for

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,310
bankruptcy than those with credit
reports showing no inquiries at all.

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,970
Finally, the report provides
important details of

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,890
any of your accounts that may have been
turned over to a collections agency.

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,490
And note that these details include
any information about lawsuits or

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,900
claims on your property,
or the garnishing or

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,100
taking of your wages as a result of
some type of lawsuit or other action.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,310
In other words, if you have been
late on your credit cards or

28
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,960
run into trouble with the law for
failure to pay your debts or

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,220
stuff like child support for your kids,
your credit report is going to reveal it.

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,910
But such oblations are not really the most
important function of the credit report.

31
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,210
So what is?

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,840
Enter stage left, your credit score.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,350
Your credit score is hands down one of
the most important numerical measurements

34
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,650
of you as a financial entity.

35
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,340
And it is a number based first and

36
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,989
foremost off a very detailed statistical
analysis of your credit report data.

37
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,830
And depending on the credit bureau
calculating the credit score,

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,700
they may use other information too.

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,610
Now, here's some good stuff to know.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,200
The standard range of credit
scores is between 300 and 850.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,080
And this should be intuitive,
the higher your score, the less

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,810
risk lenders will see you as having when
it comes to defaulting on your debts.

43
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,410
So a higher credit score will mean
both lower interest rates for

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,200
borrowing, and often, better loan terms.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,770
As a practical matter, most banks and
lenders consider anything above about 750

46
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,550
to be excellent, and scores of 800 and
above to be credit perfection.

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,620
So what are the details of this score and
what does it actually measure?

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,490
Well the most well known credit score and
industry standard is the FICO score.

49
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,602
This FICO score is actually named after
its inventor, the Fair-Isaac Corporation.

50
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:23,980
In fact, Fair-Isaac is the king of
credit scores in the marketplace.

51
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,370
As for the specific function of
the FICO score, its statistical goal

52
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,230
is to predict the likelihood of
a borrower going 90 days past due or

53
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,018
worse, in the 24 months after
the score has been calculated.

54
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:44,060
Now, besides Fair-Isaac,
there are three other main credit

55
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,830
bureaus that produce FICO-like scores
using their own proprietary models.

56
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,670
These bureaus include Equifax,
Experian, and Transunion.

57
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,340
As to why your credit score may differ
across these bureaus, most of that is due

58
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,160
to the slightly different weighted schemes
each use in their proprietary models.

59
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,040
Now, here's a key point.

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,940
In America, each citizen is entitled
to one free credit report each year

61
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,130
from each of the big three credit bureaus.

62
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,440
And here's a key tip.

63
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,190
To get your free credit report, you can
go to the website AnnualCreditReport.com.

64
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,760
This is a website run collectively by
Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,260
And note here that if you also
want to get your credit score,

66
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,940
along with your credit report,
there will be a small fee,

67
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,670
which is one of the obvious reasons these
credit bureaus sponsor that website.

68
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,990
As for how credit reports are laid out,
they will vary considerably,

69
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,190
because the different credit bureaus
do indeed have different practices.

70
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,730
That said,
there are significant commonalities.

71
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,150
For example,
most reports will include a short summary

72
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,690
of any problem areas
they notice on your case.

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,340
A sample tag line here might read,

74
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,640
proportion of balances compared
to the credit limit too high.

75
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,390
In addition to such caution flags,
your credit

76
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,510
report will also contains specific payment
data from the lines of credit you have.

77
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,620
We'll also put red flags on things
like any months where you paid late or

78
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,000
not enough.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,250
Now, here's a really important head's up.

80
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,810
The credit report companies
are far from perfect,

81
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,570
and they will sometimes make errors.

82
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,090
Unfortunately, it will be your
responsibility to correct those errors.

83
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,230
Typically, this means filing
some type of protest form,

84
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,270
requesting an investigation and
asking that the error be corrected.

85
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,110
Here, bureaus have 45 days to look into
the matter and address the mistake.

86
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,500
Now here's still another
important heads-up.

87
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,990
You are entitled to a free credit report

88
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,790
within 60 days after
a poor credit decision.

89
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,160
Such a decision might
include being denied credit.

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,510
Alternatively, the lender might
be trying to saddle you with

91
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,390
an above-market interest rate based
on your alleged higher credit risk.

92
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,770
In such cases,
lenders can't just blow you off.

93
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,080
Instead these lenders, or
creditors are legally required to tell you

94
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,740
exactly why they are offering
you substandard terms.

95
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,730
In this process,

96
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,640
they must identify the specific items that
negatively affected your application.

97
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,820
So that way when you go over your
credit report to double check it,

98
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,139
you will know exactly what to look for.

99
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,850
You can see then,
how your credit report and

100
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,810
your credit score are critical
parts of your financial life.

101
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,710
What we need to do next is to dig
more deeper into the credit score

102
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,290
number itself.

103
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,820
The goal here will be to show you
ways that this stage in your life

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,980
to strategical build and
boost your credit score.

105
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,020
So down the road when you wanna buy
that car or house, or borrow for

106
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,190
a new business venture, your loan will get
approved at the lowest possible rate and

107
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,370
with the best possible terms.

108
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,739
Not a bad goal to strive for.

109
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:03,593
So let's get on it in part three
of this lesson when you're ready.

110
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:11,449
