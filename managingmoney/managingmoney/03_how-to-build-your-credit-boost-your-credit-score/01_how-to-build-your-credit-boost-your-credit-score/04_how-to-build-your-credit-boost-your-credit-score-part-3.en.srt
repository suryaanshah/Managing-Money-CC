1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,810
So what are the best ways to
strategically boost your credit score?

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,439
These ways are no mystery as they're
routinely trumpeted by government agencies

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,257
and financial entities alike.

4
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:14,368
Unfortunately, however,
not enough borrowers hear these trumpets.

6
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:21,659
Well, let me share some of
the most important ways with you.

7
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:26,640
First and foremost, you should pay your
bills on time, all your bills whether it

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,420
be your credit card bill, your electricity
bill, your phone bill and so on.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,210
Of course I fully understand that
sometimes you might run late because

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,050
you're low on funds.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,220
However, a lot of times, and

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,730
let's be honest here, it's just plain
laziness that left those bills in a pile.

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,560
Don't do that.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,770
It has a big cost.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,600
And here's a key tip, use your online
checking account to set monthly payments

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,010
for regularly recurring bills.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,570
That way you won't forget to pay them.

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,720
Second, and in a related vein,
if you have a nasty habit of

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,080
waiting until a bill goes to a collection
agency to pay it, don't do that either.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,690
This will further lower your score and
quickly.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,460
Third, it's really important
to pay off your credit

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,790
card balances as quickly as possible,
or at least keep those balances low.

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,400
So don't fall into the minimum
payment trap I described in part

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,220
one of this lesson.

25
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:28,310
Now here's a fourth and

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,980
far more subtle tip that pertains to your
credit card limits, whatever they may be.

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,890
The key point here is to never max out
your debt relative to your credit limit.

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,740
To put it another way, if you have a lot
of debt relative to the limit on your

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,780
credit card it will have
a negative effect on your report.

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,390
Fifth, and students like us
should take particular note.

31
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,791
The credit agencies will look closely for

32
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,380
how long you have actually
had a credit history.

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,120
Here, the longer your history,
the higher your score.

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,329
Unless, of course, you have a long
history of being a deadbeat.

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,015
But the fact that history matters
offers up this key point.

36
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:12,870
You need to start your own credit
history as soon as possible.

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,590
That's why in our last lesson, I strongly
recommended that you get both a debit and

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,904
credit card, along with a checking and
savings account.

39
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:24,240
Now here are a couple of final key points.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,290
Don't go on a binge applying for
new credit on multiple fronts.

41
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,994
That will show up in the credit bureau's
algorithms and ding your credit score.

42
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:37,840
Note also that the agencies will
closely scrutinize the kinds of credit

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,050
you have and how many different
lines of credit you draw upon.

44
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,687
Now that does not mean you can't
have a separate business and

45
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:49,689
personal credit card,
that certainly won't count against you.

46
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,426
But scoring agencies will mark you
way down if you load up on too many

47
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,213
personal credit cards.

48
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:59,919
Here the typical rule is that one
personal credit card is enough.

49
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,810
So don't go getting a lot of cards
to maybe avoid the credit card

50
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,910
limits being imposed on you.

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,280
That's a con game that will quickly
be revealed in your credit report

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,110
to your detriment.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,240
Now, I wanna finish up this lesson with
a quick word about how a low credit

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,200
score can specifically impact
your life in unexpected ways.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,260
For example if you have a credit score
in the low 600s or below, you won't

56
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,230
be able to get mortgage insurance and that
may prevent you from buying a new house.

57
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,850
Your insurance premiums may also be
higher because studies have shown a link

58
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,780
between low credit scores and the higher
rate of filing insurance claims.

59
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,440
Finally, more and

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,720
more employers are using credit reports
as a way to screen job applicants.

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,210
The rationale is that those you
are more fiscally responsible will have

62
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,680
a tendency to be more responsible and
rational employees.

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,730
So don't lose your next best job simply
because you screwed up your credit score.

64
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,350
Now here's my parting shot.

65
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,040
Stripped to its essence, your credit
score is a results of the habits and

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,760
tendencies you have as a consumer.

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,070
And therefore,
a reflection of how you behave.

68
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,239
If you run high balances and
are bad with paying your bills on time,

69
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,852
your score will suffer, that's on you.

70
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:26,405
On the other hand,
if you have a smart plan, stick to it, and

71
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:30,517
keep on top of making your payments
on time, your score will be fine and

72
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:33,394
offer a firm foundation for
future prosperity.

73
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,966
Most broadly, with a good financial plan,

74
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,896
your credit score should
easily fall into place.

75
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:42,058
This will open up doors to better
credit card and loan rates,

76
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:45,978
lower insurance premiums, and maybe
even an extra edge on the job market.

77
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:55,978
