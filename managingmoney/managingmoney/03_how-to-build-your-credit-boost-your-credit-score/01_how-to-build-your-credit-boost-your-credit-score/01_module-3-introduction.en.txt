[MUSIC] HI, I'm Prof Navarro. >> And I'm Alex LeBon. >> So Mr. Alex,
what's our topic for today? >> Well, this is the to our
lecture on credit and debit cards. And we're going to dive deep into the
important task of building your credit and boosting your credit score. >> So what's the big takeaway? >> Well, for starters, don't fall into the minimum balance
trap with your credit cards. Pay your balances off as quickly
as possible, or ruin your credit. >> Easy for you to say. >> And easy for you to do if you
pay close attention to your budget. >> Okay, tough guy what else? >> Well, in a similar vain,
don't pay your bills late. And whatever you do, don't let them wind
up with a collection agency, otherwise, you'll ruin your credit score. >> [LAUGH] Aren't you
the cold-hearted economist? Sometimes people do
have a run of bad luck. They just can't pay their bills. >> Well, of course, but
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about having your funds in
your account, and letting your bills sit on your desk, because you don't
take the time to pay them. All I'm saying is it has
a heavy cost down the road. >> Fair enough. What else you got? >> Well, a bunch. This is a cool lesson. I'll show you how your credit score these
days can even affect your job prospects. >> Roger that. So let's get on with it. >> [MUSIC]
