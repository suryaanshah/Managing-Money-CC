00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,700
I wanna start out this lesson with
a bridge between our comparison of credit

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,200
and debit cards and today's topic, of
building and boosting your credit score.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,335
To cross this bridge,
let's start with this hypothetical, but

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,200
all too common scenario.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,620
Let's say your current credit
card debt is around $5,000.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,310
And you messed around a bit with
some late payments on your bills, so

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,210
now you're stuck with a penalty
interest rate of 25%.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,400
Yes, that's right.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,070
Credit card companies can charge
rates as high as 25% or more,

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,860
even when interest rates in the broader
economy are only in the single digits.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,260
How do you spell, loan shark?

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, let's further assume that
the only thing you ever do with

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,750
your credit card balance is to pay
the minimum payment each month.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,950
In fact, you just take a pair of scissors,
cut your credit card in half and

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,789
toss it in the trash.

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,913
[SOUND] Now, fast forward seven years,
at this point you

17
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:03,821
will have paid over
$5,800 in interest alone,

18
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:10,714
that's way over your starting balance and
you haven't even spent a cent.

19
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:14,201
In fact the amount of interest
you will pay on your credit cards

20
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:19,040
is highly sensitive to the interest rate
the credit card company charges you.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,430
For example, as you can discover
at a website like creditcard.com,

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,400
if you have a $5,000 balance with
a 16% annual percentage rate,

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,070
and you make a payment of $125 each month,

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,230
you would need 4.8 years and $2,000
in interest to pay off your balance.

25
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,690
Okay, that observation leads
to our first key point.

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,560
Simply that paying the minimum balance
on your credit card every month,

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,890
rather than also paying down most or
all of your balance is a losing move.

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,800
And here's a little key insight into the
mind of the average credit card issuer.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,280
When you only pay the minimum
balance that card company likes you.

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,500
>> And
I can't deny the fact that you like me.

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,720
Right now.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,540
>> These credit card companies really like
you, because you are forking out interest

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,060
payments at obscene rates and
you never default.

34
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,460
Good for the bank, but way bad for you.

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,740
So, here's your first big tip.

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,990
Pay off your credit card
balances as quickly as you can,

37
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,600
to avoid having interest
payments erode your buying power,

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,500
particularly when you're being
charge obscene interest rates.

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,100
And that key tip,
brings us to our first key question.

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,890
How the heck do so
many credit card customers

41
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,300
wind up paying exorbitant
interest rates like 25% or more?

42
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,380
>> Well, it's all about the risk the
credit card companies claim you pose with

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,010
the possibility of you defaulting
on your credit card bills.

44
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,620
Enter stage right, your own unique
credit score and credit report.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,070
Now hear this.

46
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,772
These two metrics are the single greatest
determinant of both whether you can get

47
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:01,643
credit to begin with, and
whether you'll be charged the lowest or

48
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,184
highest interest rates.

49
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,426
So we really need to understand
how credit reports and

50
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:11,625
credit scores determine both your access
to credit and the rates you'll be charged.

51
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,389
Now, on to part two, when your ready.

52
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:20,709
