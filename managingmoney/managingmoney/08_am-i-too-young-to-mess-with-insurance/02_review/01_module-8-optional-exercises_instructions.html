  <li>
   <p>
    If you drive a car, take a very good look at your insurance coverage.  What’s your deductible?  How comprehensive is your coverage?   Does your insurance company offer any discounts for good driving or good grades?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Whether you drive a car or not, go to any one of a number of insurance websites and use their “app” to figure out how much it costs to insure an older Toyota Camry (you choose the year) versus a brand new Porsche.  Are you surprised at the difference?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Carefully review your own health care plan.  (If you don’t have one, start thinking about how you might get some insurance.)  What’s your premium and deductible?  Are you in a plan with a co-pay or coinsurance?  Are there some things NOT covered by the plan that you need coverage for?  After having completed this lesson, do you see a way in which you might change your coverage to improve your situation?
