00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,830
To finish off this lesson,
let's go the big kahuna, health insurance.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,020
In fact, this type of insurance
varies a lot by country.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,660
For example, if you live in Canada or
Great Britain.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,900
You don't really have to worry
about insurance coverage.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,370
That's because both countries have
nationalized their health system.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,180
And offer universal health
care to all their citizens.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,210
Of course, in these countries,

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,290
you have a lot less choice when it
comes to what doctors you can see.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,320
What hospital you might go to, and
how long you might have to wait for

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,740
surgery if you need it.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,000
Yep, it's a big debate.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,410
Nationalized medicine versus
private healthcare providers.

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:50,010
But there's one big problem each of these
systems face, exploding healthcare costs.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,990
One reason for rising costs is that
people are simply living longer.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,619
And older people use a disproportionate
amount of healthcare.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,730
The other reason is,
new healthcare technologies and

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,110
prescription drugs both tend
to be really expensive.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,600
As a young person,

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,200
you need to know this because it will
directly affect you over your lifetime.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,140
If you are in a nationalized
healthcare system,

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,600
you'll be paying higher taxes to pay for
that system.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,180
If you are in a private
healthcare provider system.

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,340
It's likely your insurance premiums
are going to be steadily climbing.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,880
This is all the more reason you need
to shop carefully for health insurance.

25
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,160
As with auto insurance, your healthcare
plan will specify a deductible.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,590
Which for healthcare is the amount you
will have to pay our of your own pocket

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,630
each year.

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,810
Before you are eligible to
begin receiving reimbursements.

29
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,330
And as with auto insurance,
the higher the deductible you choose,

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,520
the lower your rates will be.

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,430
Now here's two new insurance concepts
to help you shop for healthcare.

32
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,240
The so called co-pay versus co-insurance.

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,970
In fact, both are forms of cost
sharing with your insurer.

34
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,400
On one hand,
a co-pay specifies a fixed amount for

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,200
a particular type of health care service.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,170
For example, your plan may specify 40
bucks as a co-pay to see a doctor.

37
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,580
And $20 to fill a prescription.

38
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,810
Of course one advantage of
a co-pay is that there's

39
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,548
no surprise about how much
a service will cost you.

40
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:32,890
In contrast, co-insurance is based

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,536
on a percentage of the cost of
the actual healthcare service.

42
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:39,395
For example, 20% co-insurance for

43
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:43,100
hospitalization means you
pay 20% of the costs.

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,593
And your health insurer
pays the other 80%.

45
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:51,180
In other words,
there's no cap as with a co-pay.

46
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,930
Risky for you, less so for the insurer.

47
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,735
So be sure to look carefully
at your co-pay and

48
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:01,220
co-insurance options when shopping a plan.

49
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,470
Because the higher the co-pay and
co-insurance you chose in your plan.

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,310
The lower the insurance premium
you will have to fork over.

51
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,470
The reason,
is that you are bearing more risk.

52
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,800
Essentially betting that you probably
won't need much health care that year.

53
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,010
Now here's another useful concept
to understand when choosing a plan,

54
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,520
you're covered benefits.

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,840
For example, plans regularly cover such
services as emergency room visits and

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,460
hospitalization.

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,220
But some may not cover things like
chiropractic services or elective surgery.

58
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,140
Be sure you know what is and isn't covered
before you sign on the dotted line.

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,910
In this same vein,

60
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,170
you'll want to look very carefully at
what prescription drugs are covered.

61
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,800
For example,

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,280
some plans try to force you to buy
generics rather than the branded drug.

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,250
However, that can be an issue.

64
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,310
Since there is considerable
debate about whether generics

65
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,800
reach the same level of quality.

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,540
In fact, many generics aren't
necessarily duplicated drugs.

67
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,380
But rather more like
approximations of the original.

68
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,630
As the final key decision parameter,
there is the out-of-pocket maximum.

69
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,440
This is the most you will have
to pay during a policy period.

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,270
Typically a year before your plan starts
to pay 100% of the allowed amount.

71
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,340
Again, the higher
the out-of-pocket maximum,

72
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,358
the lower your insurance premium will be.

73
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:32,300
Like the co-pay and

74
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,760
deductible, there's a trade-off between
the risk you bear and the rates you pay.

75
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,280
The broader point here is that health
care is one of the most important

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,410
forms of insurance you will buy.

77
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,630
And it's as you age,
it will grow in importance.

78
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,230
Just like bankers and lenders health
insurers are not necessarily your friends.

79
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,390
It's more like they're out
to make a buck off you.

80
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,900
So shop well, so

81
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,462
you can stay well, and never get
surprised if you get sick or injured.

82
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:09,010
To find out you are not fully covered for
what might ail you

83
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:19,010
