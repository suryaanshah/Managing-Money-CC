00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:11,276
Hi, I'm
>> And.

3
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:14,016
>> All right, what's on the docket for
today Mr. Alex?

4
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:18,370
>> Well, it's a topic that is right
up there with death and taxes.

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,040
When it comes to the certainty you'll
need it over the coarse of your life.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,430
>> Talking about insurance, are we?

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,560
>> Indeed.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,640
Auto, home, renter's, life, and
the biggest of them all, health insurance.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,330
>> All right.
What's the big takeaway in this lesson?

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,240
>> Simply that, unless you're Superman,
and even he gets hit

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,930
with the occasional kryptonite,
it pays to be adequately insured.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,230
>> Adequately?

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,250
That's a bit vague.

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,160
Can you be a little bit
more precise there?

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,030
>> Well, you will have to view
the lesson for the answer to that.

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,630
>> Fair enough.
But before we go there,

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,145
do you have any good insurance jokes?

18
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,660
>> [LAUGH] Not a single one.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,600
The topic is about as
funny as a traffic jam.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,527
But hey, it's necessary.

21
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:03,479
>> Roger that.

22
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,383
So have it when you're ready.

23
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:13,859
