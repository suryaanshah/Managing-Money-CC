1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,640
You've probably seen the bumper sticker
around that says, stuff happens.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,790
When it happens,
you can take a pretty big financial hit.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,410
If you haven't prepared for that hit,
it could have pretty dire consequences.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,960
You could lose your house or your car or

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,830
maybe even your life if you can't
afford the very best medical care.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,050
Of course, it's possible to
self-insure against disaster,

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,180
just by saving up a bunch of money.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,900
We encourage you to have
an emergency savings reserve.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,820
But that said, usually pays to be insured.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,820
As for the big idea behind
the concept of insurance, here it is.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,420
Risk Pooling.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,080
What do I mean by that?

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,282
Well, as the poet John Donne,

14
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:51,740
once said, no person is an island,
but rather part of a broader me.

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,080
To put this in context, you're one of a
group of people that faces various risks.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,030
But for each person in the group,
there is a relatively small probability

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,560
that an accident or
bad event will occur in any given year.

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,090
Of course, if you are the actual
one in the group that is unlucky,

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,350
the financial consequences
can be devastating.

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,240
So the idea of insurance, is to put
you in with the rest of the group, so

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,880
that each of you can chip in
a relatively small amount of money

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,300
in case one of you needs
a big accident payoff.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,850
That's called pooling the risk, and

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,890
it is a concept that cuts across
virtually every kind of insurance.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,110
The other important part of the risk
pooling concept to know about

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,910
is that you are rarely thrown in with
the entire population to form a risk pool.

27
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,340
Instead, insurance underwriters will group
you by risk, and charge rates accordingly.

28
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,460
For example, as a young driver
in a young driver risk pool,

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,370
you are going to pay higher car
insurance rates than normal.

30
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,490
That's because statistics show that young
drivers are more likely to get into

31
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,560
accidents, particularly
young male drivers.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,180
But don't worry.

33
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,660
I'm going to show you how you can
get your insurance costs down,

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,820
even if you are stuck
in a high risk group.

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,910
Okay.
With that as our big picture background,

36
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,520
let's dig into some details
as we ask ourselves this.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,410
Just what can be insured?

38
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,140
Well, just about everything,
cars, homes, businesses,

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,870
equipment, even your own
life can be insured.

40
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,910
But it doesn't stop there.

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,710
There are specialty insurers out there
like the famous Lloyd's of London,

42
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,890
that can underwrite insurance policies for
nearly anything you can imagine.

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,700
If you can afford it.

44
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,710
Some famous examples include
Keith Richard's fingers, Bob Dylan's vocal

45
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,380
cords, and American football player
Troy Polamalu's signature hairdo.

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,590
While there are lots of different
kinds of insurance policies out there,

47
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,580
the language of the business is universal.

48
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,260
So, let's start with
the most basic of terms.

49
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,910
The insurance premium.

50
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,740
Here's Investopedia's
typically bone-dry definition.

51
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,460
The specified amount of payment
required periodically by an insurer to

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,509
provide coverage under a given insurance
plan for a defined period of time.

53
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,150
Basically, that means you,
the insured person, pay the premium,

54
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,580
your small known loss, in exchange for
the insurance company's promise to pay or

55
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,170
indemnify you in case
of a much larger loss.

56
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,320
And by the way,

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,910
one of the most important jobs in the
insurance industry is that of the actuary.

58
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,560
You may want to look into
that as a career option

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,620
if you have a statistical perspective and
enjoy the process of prediction.

60
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,220
As for what actuaries actually do, they
make estimates of the ultimate outcomes of

61
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,580
insurable events using both past
statistics and forward-looking models.

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,610
In this task, they work hand in
hand with insurance underwriters.

63
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,810
Together, their job is to evaluate
the risks of insuring folks like you, or

64
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,750
an asset you might own.

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,430
This allows them to set their premiums
to ensure their profitability.

66
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,704
Of course,
your job is to get the best deal you can.

67
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:29,119
Now, hear this key tip.

68
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:34,520
If you know what insurance companies
are looking for before you seek coverage,

69
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,638
you will be a better consumer,
thereby avoid any bad deals.

70
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:47,349
