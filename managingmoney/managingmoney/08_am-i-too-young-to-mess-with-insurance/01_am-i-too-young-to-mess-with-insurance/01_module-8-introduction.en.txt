[MUSIC] Hi, I'm
>> And. >> All right, what's on the docket for
today Mr. Alex? >> Well, it's a topic that is right
up there with death and taxes. When it comes to the certainty you'll
need it over the coarse of your life. >> Talking about insurance, are we? >> Indeed. Auto, home, renter's, life, and
the biggest of them all, health insurance. >> All right.
What's the big takeaway in this lesson? >> Simply that, unless you're Superman,
and even he gets hit with the occasional kryptonite,
it pays to be adequately insured. >> Adequately? That's a bit vague. Can you be a little bit
more precise there? >> Well, you will have to view
the lesson for the answer to that. >> Fair enough.
But before we go there, do you have any good insurance jokes? >> [LAUGH] Not a single one. The topic is about as
funny as a traffic jam. But hey, it's necessary. >> Roger that. So have it when you're ready. [MUSIC]
