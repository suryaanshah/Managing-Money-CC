1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,850
Have you bought your first car yet?

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,430
Or maybe your parents bought you one for
your high school graduation.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,890
Lucky you.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,440
At any rate, as soon as you
start driving your own vehicle,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,040
you are likely going to need insurance.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,250
But this isn't a one-size-fits-all
thing by any means.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,610
There's a big menu of
coverages to choose from, and

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,210
we need to work our way
through them to get you ready.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,800
Let's start with simple
liability coverage.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,950
Here's why this is the absolute minimum
vehicle insurance coverage you should get.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,040
When you cause an accident,
you can be held accountable for

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,470
the resulting injuries or property damage.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,320
The costs can be well outside your budget.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,390
But if you are unable to pay,

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,720
you will risk losing your assets as
a result of a lawsuit against you.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,680
To protect yourself, all you need to
do is buy liability insurance for

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,190
both property damage and personal injury.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,280
In fact, in most states in America,

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,530
liability coverage is mandatory to
legally own and operate a vehicle.

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,250
And the only discretionary
part of the decision

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,910
is how much coverage above
the minimum required you want to buy.

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,700
Of course, beyond such liability coverage,

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,560
you can also buy collision insurance
as well as comprehensive coverage for

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,810
things like fire, theft, vandalism and
even emergency road coverage.

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,770
On this last point,
the decision to buy theft coverage for

26
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,650
example, can be an interesting one.

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,250
If you have an old to beater car that
is fully paid for, you may not want

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,480
to incur the cost of theft insurance and
simply bear the risk yourself.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,810
On the other hand, if you have a brand
new car with a big auto loan or

30
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,450
a brand of car like a Honda Civic or
a Toyota Camry

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,350
that are favorite targets of thieves,
theft insurance may by prudent.

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,120
And may even be required
by the terms of your loan.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,510
In considering vehicle insurance,

34
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,200
one of the most important choices is
the amount of your so called deductible.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,670
This is the dollar amount that
you must cover whenever you make

36
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,450
an insurance claim.

37
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,050
For example, suppose a ladder in
your garage drops on your car and

38
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,620
you accidentally dent your cars fender.

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,950
Let's further suppose,
the cost of the repair will be $800 but

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,180
you have a deductible specified in
your insurance policy of $1000.

41
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,350
In this case, you are simply out of luck.

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,480
The full cost of the repair will
come out of your own pocket.

43
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,555
As to why you are dumb enough to
choose such a high deductible,

44
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:50,350
it may actually have been
a pretty smart choice, why?

45
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,440
Because everything else being equal,
when you choose a higher deductible

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,940
on an insurance policy,
you will get a lower rate.

47
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,760
That's because you've assumed
a bit more of the risk.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,290
In this particular example,
it didn't work out, but

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,450
over time that high deductible
might still save you money.

50
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,650
The broader point is, that choosing your
deductible is one of the most important

51
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,030
choices you make in choosing
your insurance policy.

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,560
For cars, homes, and just about
everything else you will insure.

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,710
But be sure to shop around and
compare rates on all the key parameters.

54
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,550
Next, I want to talk about
how insurance rates and

55
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,350
premiums are actually determined.

56
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,970
By knowing what factors go
into calculating your premium,

57
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,750
this can help you reduce your rates.

58
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,475
The biggest factor in determining your car
insurance premium is your driving history,

59
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:46,650
much like credit scores,
when you are young and

60
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,980
just starting out,
you have no history and are charged more.

61
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,380
Likewise, if you have been driving for
a while, and have a record filled with

62
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:01,050
speeding tickets and accidents,
you are likely to have very steep rates.

63
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,440
So easing up on the gas pedal
will not only save you fuel and

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,960
ticket costs, it will also potentially
save you some money in insurance.

65
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,260
The next biggest factor is
based on the car you drive.

66
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,220
The more expensive your car is,
the higher year rates are going to be.

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,670
A 2010 Ford Fiesta is going to be cheaper
too insure than a brand new Lexus.

68
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,377
More subtly, however,

69
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:32,760
there's also the perceived risks
associated with a particular brand of car.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,297
Going back to one of our
original examples in lesson one,

71
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:40,942
you may remember that the profligate
grasshopper, Juan, drove a fast and

72
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:45,680
fancy Porsche, which statistics show
is more likely to get in an accident.

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,280
While the stable ant, Juanita,
opted for a low-key Camry.

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,180
On this decision alone, Juanita saved
a lot more money relative to Juan,

75
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,220
because the insurance premium on a fast
sports car would likely be double or

76
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,560
more than that of a lowly sedan.

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,250
Now beyond the value and
risk of the car being insured and

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,200
your driving record, the insurance
companies also take a very good look

79
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,470
at other aspects of your personal profile.

80
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:24,630
Here, the four biggest factors are gender,
age, marital status, and employment.

81
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,840
For example,

82
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,660
as another statistical truism,
men are more accident prone than women.

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,010
Interestingly enough,

84
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:40,390
statistics also show that married people
are safer drivers as a group than singles.

85
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,810
Although, I am certainly not
encouraging you to tie the knot

86
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,820
any time soon just to lower
your auto insurance rates.

87
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,740
I will however offer this key tip.

88
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,080
At least some insurance companies will
give you a discount for good grades,

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,450
because statistically, that correlates
with safer driving behavior.

90
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,000
Apparently, geeks do rule.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Given that we students are already charged
some of the highest premiums around,

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,830
you may want to consider
this financial incentive

93
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,440
the next time you want to blow off
your homework or an important class.

94
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,990
Hey, Ferris Bueller probably
had higher car insurance rates.

95
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,850
Now, the last type of insurance I
want to talk about before ending part

96
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,020
two of this lesson, is something you as
a student may find especially helpful.

97
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,380
This is renter's insurance.

98
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,580
While you certainly won't need to
insure your rental unit itself,

99
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,633
that's the landlord's job,
you might have enough computers,

100
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:46,220
stereo equipment and various other
things that have significant value.

101
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,940
If you possessions are stolen during
a break-in or damaged by a fire or

102
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,550
severe weather, a renter's insurance
policy allows you to recover their value.

103
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,936
By the way,
with some renter's insurance policies,

104
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,550
you can now even insure yourself
against identity theft.

105
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,960
Maybe not a bad idea in these wild
times on the virtual frontier.

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:15,629
