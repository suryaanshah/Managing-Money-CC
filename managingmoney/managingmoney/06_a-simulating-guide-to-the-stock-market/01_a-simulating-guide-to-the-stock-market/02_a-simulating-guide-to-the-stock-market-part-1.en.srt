1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,470
Okay, I want to start off this lecture
with what appears to be a really

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,950
simple question.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,300
Which of these three activities,
poker, roulette, and

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,900
stock market investing,
represent pure gambling?

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,757
Which of these three activities
represent intelligent speculation?

6
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:23,984
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:26,430
Okay, I confess.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,060
This is a bit of a trick question,

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,600
because you may have been tempted
to answer both poker and roulette.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,730
In fact, of these three activities.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,690
Only roulette really is pure gambling,
while both poker and

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,040
stock market investing at least
should be games of speculation.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,420
So what the heck's the difference between
gambling and speculation, and why is it so

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,170
important when it comes to
stock market investing?

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,310
Well, here's the deal.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,210
Gambling involves games of pure chance
that don't involve any real skill.

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,860
And on the roulette tables
in the casinos of the world,

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,330
the house, that is the casino owners,
always win.

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,830
Why is that so?

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,110
Because the house always stacks the deck,
so that the odds of you consistently

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,591
winning at games like roulette
are always less than 50-50.

22
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:20,170
To see what I mean,
look closely at this roulette wheel.

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,680
If you bet every time on either black or
red, you will eventually lose.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,848
Why?

25
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:29,290
Because those 2 green slots on the table,

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,460
tip the odds in the house's favor to
a less than 50, 50 chance of winning.

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,230
So if you want to gamble, do it for fun.

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,020
But don't expect to make
any real money over time.

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,290
Intelligent speculation is a totally
different endeavor, however.

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,780
It involves trying to move
the odds in your favor.

31
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,210
Just why is poker, unlike roulette,
a game of intelligent speculation.

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,790
Well, if you are a good strategist and
know the odds better than you opponents of

33
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,960
what cards are likely to come up,
you may not win every time,

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,430
but over a series of hands,
you should win more than you lose.

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,070
That's the way stock market investing and
trading should be, and the way you

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,760
intelligently speculate on stocks is
to do your research and homework.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,420
Not act on impulse around some
hot stock tip from a buddy.

38
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,330
As to how to intelligently speculate,
suppose you are thinking about buying

39
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,410
a blue chip or highly regarded stock,
like Procter & Gamble.

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,650
You can go to a website like
Yahoo Finance or Google Finance, and

41
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,640
find a wealth of information
about the stock.

42
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,770
To begin,
you have to find the stock symbol.

43
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,480
Once you've got that,
you can then go to the information page.

44
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,540
A good place to start here is by
looking at the profile of the company.

45
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,570
Give it a careful read.

46
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,408
I mean heck, find out what the company
your about to buy shares in actually does.

47
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:01,161
Next, you might then look at the one
year chart to see how the company's been

48
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:01,890
doing lately.

49
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,990
Wow, that's a pretty
ugly sideways pattern.

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,510
By sideways pattern, I mean that over the
last year, the stock has been pretty much

51
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,560
treading water, neither going up much or
going down much.

52
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,630
But what about a longer time frame?

53
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,780
Let's look at the five year chart.

54
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,535
Here we have a nice upward trend.

55
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,835
So at least, over a longer time frame, you
could've made money on Procter & Gamble,

56
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,715
if you had bought it
five years ago that is.

57
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:32,045
Another item that is usually
pretty interesting for

58
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,820
your research is the analysts' opinions.

59
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,640
These opinions tell you what the experts
who follow the stock are thinking.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,820
Check this out.

61
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,100
This is a pretty ugly
set of evaluations for

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,010
Procter & Gamble, because you see a lot
of analyst downgrades on this stock.

63
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,850
So, even though Procter & Gamble
maybe one of the bluest of blue-chip

64
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,960
stocks in the world,
this may not be the right time to buy And

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,680
now buying the stock now is a good
example of intelligent speculation.

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,210
Sometimes what you don't do is
better than what you actually do.

67
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,160
Of course, we don't have the time in this
short course to get any further into

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,970
the details of just what to look for
to become an intelligent stock speculator.

69
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,770
But the bottom line here is if you want
to make money investing in stocks,

70
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:23,010
it takes time and effort,
not hot tips and dumb luck.

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,978
Okay, let's move on to part two of
this lecture, when you are ready.

72
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:36,619
