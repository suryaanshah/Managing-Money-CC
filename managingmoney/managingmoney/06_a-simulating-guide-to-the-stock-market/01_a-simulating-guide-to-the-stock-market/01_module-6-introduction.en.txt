[MUSIC] Hi, Prof Navarro here. >> And I'm Alex LeBon. >> Okay Alex, what do you have for
us in this lesson? >> Well this is part two of our
discussion about investing. And we're going to drill down on some
of the mysteries of the stock market. >> Cool.
You know the definitive joke on stock trading? >> No, but
I figure you're going to tell me. >> Yeah.
So, here it is. How do you make a small fortune
investing in the stock market? >> Hm. Start with a large fortune? >> You stole my punchline, dude. >> Well, I do that a lot. >> Okay, smart guy. What are the big takeaways
from this lesson? Well first and foremost the stock
market is not a Las Vegas casino. Need to be an intelligent speculator in
the stock market and not a pure gambler. That means research and preparation. Second, I will show you how to make
money on a stock that's going to involve a combination of what we call
dividends and capital gains. And then third, in today's world
of exchange traded funds, or so called ETFs, companies aren't
the only things you can trade. You can also buy shares of
sectors like technology and energy as well as shares of major
stock exchanges like the S&P 500. Finally, I am going to show our students
how to use a stock market simulator to learn some of the many tricks
of stock market trading. And it's far better to
use a simulator first so that you don't lose any real money
learning the stock market ropes. >> All right Mister Alex, off you go. [MUSIC]
