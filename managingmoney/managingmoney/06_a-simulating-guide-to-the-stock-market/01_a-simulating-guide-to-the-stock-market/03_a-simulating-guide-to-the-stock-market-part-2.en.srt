1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,520
Since we are talking about stock
market investing a good place to start

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,260
might be with an explanation of
what a stock market actually is.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,940
Basically a stock market
is like a physical place

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,420
like the New York Stock Exchange or it
could be a virtual place like the NASDAQ

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,279
market where stocks are bought and sold.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,950
And by the way,
the New York Stock Exchange and

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,820
NASDAQ are both located
in the United States.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,050
And they rank number one and
two in the world in terms of the value of

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,540
the companies that are traded
on these exchanges.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,900
In addition, around the world,

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,600
some of the most important stock exchanges
include England's London Stock Exchange,

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,540
Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange China's
Shanghai and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges,

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,600
India's Bombay Stock Exchange and
Brazil's BMF Bovespa.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,950
As to actually what can be
traded on these exchanges,

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,100
the first obvious answer is "Stock" in
companies, but what are stocks actually?

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,020
They're more than just a piece of paper,
some bytes and

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,980
bits that seem to magically
fluctuate in value.

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,520
Stocks are actually tiny shares
of ownership in a company.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,400
So for example, if you want to buy shares
of an American company like Apple,

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,030
its stock symbol is AAPL and
it is listed on the NASDAQ exchange.

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,570
After buying some shares,
you would be a part owner of Apple itself,

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,700
along with the many others who hold stock.

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,560
Depending on the type of stock,
how many shares you own and

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,120
whether it is traded publicly to anyone
who wants to buy some in an exchange,

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,280
you can be entitled to dividends,
the opportunity to attend shareholder's

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,340
meetings, and sometimes participate
in votes about company decisions.

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,990
As to how you actually make money, The key
concept here is that of total return.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,710
The idea of total return on a stock is
that your gains consist of two components.

29
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,250
The first component is the annual
dividend a stock may pay out to you as

30
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,710
a shareholder.

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,040
To that you must add any price
appreciation on the stock

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,110
over the course of a year.

33
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,060
Suppose then that you buy one share
of stock for $100 on January 1st,

34
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,500
in the fictional United Conglomerate
Industries, stock symbol UCI.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,860
Over the course of the year,
the price increases to $105,

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,340
while UCI pays you nice
little dividend of $5.

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,460
So, what's your total return for the year?

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,590
Well you certainly don't need
any calculus to answer that one.

39
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,140
Your total return for
the year is simply 10%.

40
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,210
Five bucks of price appreciation
plus five bucks of dividend

41
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,390
divided by your original purchase price.

42
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,110
Now here's our next important point.

43
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,110
It's not just companies that are traded
in the stock market these days.

44
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,870
In 1993 a new type of trading instrument
called the Exchange Traded Fund was born.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
The short-hand name for
these instruments is ETFs.

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,880
And today, using ETFs you can trade
entire market sectors, like energy,

47
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,810
technology, or health care using
ETFs like XLE, XLK and XLV.

48
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:16,425
The advantage of trading a sector rather
than just a company within that sector

49
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:19,315
is that you eliminate
what's called company risk.

50
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:23,085
The idea here is that
a sector like housing or

51
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:26,230
pharmaceuticals might be doing very well,
but

52
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,530
one particular company within that
sector may fall on some bad luck.

53
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,130
If you invest in that
particularly star-crossed

54
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,870
company to take advantage of a favorable
sector trend, you'll be out of luck.

55
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,310
But if you use an ETF to invest in
the sector itself, you'll do much better.

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,870
The same idea behind sector ETF investing
is also behind that class of ETFs that

57
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,630
allow you to buy the broad
market of a country

58
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,850
rather than any of the individual
sectors or companies within that market.

59
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,880
For example, suppose you don't want
to bother trying to pick a company or

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,130
a sector, but

61
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,889
simply want to speculate on a broad market
like the S&P 500 in the United States.

62
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:10,070
This market index contains the 500
largest companies in the US

63
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,495
with a collected value
of over $5 trillion.

64
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,640
If you wanna buy a piece of this rock,

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,980
all you need to do is invest in
the exchange traded fund SPY.

66
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,700
The beauty of investing in a stock
market index fund like SPY

67
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,780
is that it eliminates both company and
sector risk.

68
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,908
As to how you actually go about buying and
selling stocks,

69
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:36,780
that requires you to set
up a stock trading account.

70
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,250
Just like stock market investing itself
you also want to do your homework here

71
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,000
as there are many different
vendors to choose from.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,420
Here's just one top ten
review list to look over.

73
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,853
It includes such familiar names as
E*Trade, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab.

74
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:01,236
Some key parameters you wanna look at in
making your decisions include how much

75
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:03,810
commission do you want to pay per trade.

76
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,820
And more importantly for beginners,
how easy is the trading platform to use.

77
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,800
Note here that as a general rule,
you tend to get less service,

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,780
the lower commission rate per trade.

79
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,670
So choose wisely.

80
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,240
Now, before you take
the stock market plunge,

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,550
I'm going to suggest that you spend a good
year or more learning to trade and invest

82
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,845
using a simulated stock market game,
like Stock Check or Wall Street Survivor.

83
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:31,105
There's a very simple reason for
starting with simulated trading.

84
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:35,005
Most people who jump right into stock
trading with real money, lose most or

85
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:36,435
all of that money.

86
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:41,160
As the cynics on Wall Street say,
that's paying your tuition to the market.

87
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,330
So hold your horses and
practice first with play money and

88
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,240
that's what I will show you how to do
in the last module of this lesson.

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,849
