1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,320
In this section I wanna go over
some of the basics of stock

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,570
trading you may find helpful.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,620
But before I do that.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,230
I want to emphasize the importance
of learning how to trade stocks

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,630
in a simulated game environment.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,330
That's what a lot of students do at the
UCI business school, and you should too.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,970
The idea behind a stock market simulator
is that you're given a fixed sum of money,

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,120
like $1 million.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,010
And you are allowed to trade that
money over a fixed period of time.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,130
The cool part about
stock market simulators.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,860
Is that they rely on actual real-time
data from the stock markets themselves.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,060
So they only actual difference
between trading on a simulator.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,790
And trading on your own stock market
account, is that you are using play money.

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,780
As for which stock simulator to use,
there are bunch of them out there.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,170
But it is hard to go wrong
with Wall Street Survivor.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,000
So our suggestion in this course,
is that you go ahead and

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,090
set up an account at this or
a similar simulator.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,780
Yes it's free.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,060
As for stock trading itself,
here's just a few key concepts.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,190
Let's start with market
versus limit orders.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,350
With a market order,
the stock you want to buy.

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,600
Is purchased at whatever price is
clearing in the market at the time you

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,130
make your trade.

24
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,010
The advantage of a market order is that
you are assured that it will be filled.

25
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,870
But you may pay too high a price if you
happen to buy on a big momentum swing

26
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,540
during the day.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,560
In contrast, with a limit order
you can set your price so

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,910
as to not exceed a certain amount.

29
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,660
For example, suppose you wanna
buy another share of UCI.

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,020
And you think it's a good
deal at any price below $105.

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,650
However, if you have to
pay a price above $105.

32
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,920
You don't think that the reward you are
likely to earn, will be worth the risk.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
So with a limit order,

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,700
all you need to do is set your
limit priced at $105 in this case.

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,570
Of course, the down side of a limit order
is that the order may not be filled if

36
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,721
the price remains above $105.

37
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:02,930
Now, a second key concept
is that of stop losses.

38
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,950
A key point here is that
when you buy a stock,

39
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,790
you need to carefully manage your risk.

40
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,300
What do I mean by that?

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,360
Well of course you're buying that stock
on the speculation that it will rise.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
But despite all your careful research,
the stock might actually fall.

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,070
And if it falls a lot, you can lose a lot
of money, and sometimes very quickly.

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,120
The idea of a stop loss is
to put in a sell order.

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,370
So that if your stock falls
below a certain amount.

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,990
Then the stock is automatically sold.

47
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,720
A good rule here is to never
lose more than 10% in a stock.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,825
So for example,
if you buy a share of UCI at $100,

49
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,990
you might wanna put in
a stop loss order for $90.

50
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:47,010
And here's a cool related concept,
that of the trailing stop loss.

51
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,180
The idea here is to never
turn a winner into a loser.

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,310
So for example if you buy UCI at $100 and
it goes to $110.

53
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,760
The wise thing to do here might be to
raise your stop loss order to $100

54
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,930
rather than the original 90.

55
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,130
So if UCI falls back down,
you at least didn't lose any money and

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,090
therefore didn't turn
a winner into a loser.

57
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,840
These are just some of the many
tricks of the stock market trade.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,250
That you'll need to learn to make money
on your stock market investments.

59
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,210
While you may not have a lot of money
to invest just now in the stock market.

60
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,580
Over time as you get better and
better jobs at higher and

61
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,030
higher pay,
at least that's what we all hope for.

62
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,079
You'll begin to accumulate capital
that you'll need to invest.

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,840
So if you pay your tuition to
the stock market now using play money.

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,190
And learn how stock trading works.

65
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,090
You'll live a far more prosperous life.

66
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,260
And that's what managing
your money is all about.

67
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,429
