00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:09,633
Hi, Prof Navarro here.

3
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,053
>> And I'm Alex LeBon.

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,160
>> Okay Alex, what do you have for
us in this lesson?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,930
>> Well this is part two of our
discussion about investing.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,520
And we're going to drill down on some
of the mysteries of the stock market.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,216
>> Cool.
You know the definitive joke on

8
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:22,800
stock trading?

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,840
>> No, but
I figure you're going to tell me.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,870
>> Yeah.
So, here it is.

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,950
How do you make a small fortune
investing in the stock market?

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,090
>> Hm.

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,170
Start with a large fortune?

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,860
>> You stole my punchline, dude.

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,290
>> Well, I do that a lot.

16
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,130
>> Okay, smart guy.

17
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,370
What are the big takeaways
from this lesson?

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,165
Well first and foremost the stock
market is not a Las Vegas casino.

19
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:46,940
Need to be an intelligent speculator in
the stock market and not a pure gambler.

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,680
That means research and preparation.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,790
Second, I will show you how to make
money on a stock that's going to involve

22
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,032
a combination of what we call
dividends and capital gains.

23
00:00:57,032 --> 00:01:00,420
And then third, in today's world
of exchange traded funds, or so

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,360
called ETFs, companies aren't
the only things you can trade.

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,060
You can also buy shares of
sectors like technology and

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,530
energy as well as shares of major
stock exchanges like the S&P 500.

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,300
Finally, I am going to show our students
how to use a stock market simulator to

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,970
learn some of the many tricks
of stock market trading.

29
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,494
And it's far better to
use a simulator first so

30
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:24,260
that you don't lose any real money
learning the stock market ropes.

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,010
>> All right Mister Alex, off you go.

32
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:33,529
