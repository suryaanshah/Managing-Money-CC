# History
[Managing Your Money: MBA Insights for Undergraduates](https://www.coursera.org/learn/managingmoney) was a great introductory course on coursera about personal finance. Sadly it has been archived now, and not available on the internet. 

I had a downloaded version of the course, however it was hard for me to keep track of the lectures I had watched and the ones I hadn't. I couldn't even attempt the quizes.
So, I took that as a challenge to fix this problem, and create a website for this course so that I and other people can conviniently take it.
